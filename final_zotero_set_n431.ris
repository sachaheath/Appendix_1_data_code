AB  - The extent and continued expansion of urbanisation has focused attention on the significance for native biodiversity of those green spaces remaining within such areas and the most appropriate methods of managing them. In the UK, a high proportion of urban space is comprised of the private or domestic gardens associated with residential dwellings, and many recommendations have been made for simple changes to improve their value for biodiversity ('wildlife gardening'). Here, we report the results of replicated experimental tests of five such common recommendations, involving the introduction to gardens of (i) artificial nest sites for solitary bees and wasps; (ii) artificial nest sites for bumblebees; (iii) small ponds; (iv) dead wood for fungi and other saproxylic organisms; and ( v) patches of nettles Urtica dioica L. for butterfly larvae. The broad conclusion is that whilst some methods for increasing the biodiversity of garden environments may be very effective, others have a low probability of success on the timescales and spatial scales likely to be acceptable to many garden owners. If one of the functions of small scale biodiversity enhancement is to develop and encourage awareness of biodiversity and its conservation, then encouragement to conduct particular activities must be balanced with a realistic appraisal of their likely success.

AU  - Head, Lesley

AB  - The Sydney Basin Bioregion has high native species diversity, a large proportion of its land area under conservation tenure and over five million human residents. Environmental management strategies developed on the basis of an ecological and biogeographical literature that is either blind to the human presence or views it solely as a threat are unlikely to be effective in such a context. Humans will need to be re-imagined and co-opted as active co-constructors of this nature rather than solely as threats to it. We bring ethnographic and biogeographic evidence together to address this practical challenge, analysing the attitudes and practices of 38 backyarders who live adjacent to, or in close proximity to, bushland. Results are summarised along a continuum between restoration and gardening. Important themes are boundaries and boundedness between domestic and outside space, engagement and stewardship on public land, and nurturing and vigilance behaviours.

AB  - Two consequences of the continued urbanisation of the human population are that a growing proportion of the landscape is less hospitable to, and that a growing proportion of people are disconnected from, native biodiversity. One response of the UK government has been to establish a goal, and an associated baseline indicator, of increasing the extent and range of public participation in gardening for wildlife. The formulation of policy to attain this end requires, however, insight into the factors that are associated with the level of participation. Here we examine the relationships, across 15 areas in five UK cities, between the proportion of households providing various garden features for wildlife or participating in various wildlife gardening activities, and housing densities and characteristics of the garden resource. We show that significant numbers of households participate in some form of wildlife gardening, but that the predominant form this participation takes is feeding wild birds. Key variables associated with spatial variation in wildlife gardening activities are the proportion of households with access to a garden and, more importantly, average garden size and the proportion of land cover by gardens. There was no evidence for strong effects of household density or the socio-economic status of householders on the prevalence of wildlife friendly features in gardens or on the participation by householders in activities to encourage wildlife. Our results suggest important considerations in attempts to increase awareness and participation in wildlife gardening.

AB  - The human population is increasingly disconnected from nature due to urbanisation. To counteract this phenomenon, the UK government has been actively promoting wildlife gardening. However, the extent to which such activities are conducted and the level of resource provision for biodiversity (e.g., food and nesting sites) within domestic gardens remains poorly documented. Here we generate estimates for a selection of key resources provided within gardens at a national scale, using 12 survey datasets gathered across the UK. We estimate that 22.7 million households (87% of homes) have access to a garden. Average garden SiZe is 190 m(2), extrapolating to a total area of 432,924 ha. Although substantial, this coverage is still an order of magnitude less than that of statutory protected areas. Approximately 12.6 million (48%) households provide supplementary food for birds, 7.4 million of which specifically use bird feeders. Similarly, there are a minimum of 4.7 million nest boxes within gardens. These figures equate to one bird feeder for every nine potentially feeder-using birds in the UK, and at least one nest box for every six breeding pairs of cavity nesting birds. Gardens also contain 2.5-3.5 million ponds and 28.7 million trees, which is just under a quarter of all trees occurring outside woodlands. Ongoing urbanisation, characterised by increased housing densities, is inevitable throughout the UK and elsewhere. The important contribution domestic gardens make to the green space infrastructure in residential areas must be acknowledged, as their reduction will impact biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and the well-being of the human population.

T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - The loss of habitat due to suburban and urban development represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Conservation developments have emerged as a key player for reconciling new ex-urban residential development with ecosystem services. However, as more than half of the world population lives in urban and suburban developments, identifying conservation partners to facilitate retrofitting existing residential neighborhoods becomes paramount. Homeowner associations (HOA) manage a significant proportion of residential developments in the United States, which includes the landscape design for yards and gardens. These areas have the potential to mitigate the loss of urban biodiversity when they provide habitat for native wildlife. Therefore, the conditions and restrictions imposed upon the homeowner by the HOA could have profound effects on the local wildlife habitat. We explored the potential of HOAs to promote conservation by synthesizing research from three monitoring programs from Phoenix, Arizona. We compared native bird diversity, arthropod diversity, and plant diversity between neighborhoods with and without a HOA. Neighborhoods belonging to HOAs had significantly greater bird and plant diversity, although insect diversity did not differ. The institutional framework structuring HOAs, including sanctions for enforcement coupled with a predictable maintenance regime that introduces regular disturbance, might explain why neighborhoods with a HOA had greater bird diversity. For neighborhoods with a HOA, we analyzed landscape form and management practices. We linked these features with ecological function and suggested how to modify management practices by adopting strategies from the Sustainable Sites Initiative, an international sustainable landscaping program, to help support biodiversity in current and future residential landscapes.

AB  - It is being increasingly recognized that the success of efforts to preserve/restore biodiversity in urban areas is highly contingent on the preferences of human urban dwellers. We investigated preference ratings for photos of high- versus low-habitat-providing garden landscapes among residents (n = 487) in two specific areas of Perth, Western Australia, and their relationship with general environmental concern and attitudes toward native plants and urban biodiversity. We also investigated the impact of localized descriptive gardening norms. The findings indicate that the distinction between high-/low-habitat-providing gardens was important to respondents' landscape preferences. The attitudinal variable with the strongest relationship to garden-type preference was residents' attitudes toward native plants. Preferences were also highly related to prevailing gardening norms in respondents' local area. We discuss our findings in relation to the structure and dynamics involved in human perceptions of and interactions with urban landscapes.

AB  - Urban biodiversity management in most African countries is at a peripheral stage. At the same time, African urban areas substantially remain poorly planned and intensively growing. This study explores the socio-ecological system as an alternative approach to explore African indigenous urban biodiversity management. For this purpose, we mixed conventional scientific investigation methods to explain the biodiversity conservation in the ancient gardens of the Kano palace in northern Nigeria. This multidisciplinary approach has successfully unveiled a harmonious relationship of humans and ecosystems in the context of African cultural values and heritage systems. The paper reveals that the palace gardens offer an avenue for intersection of a wide range of ecological and cultural activities. These include biodiversity conservation, recreation, security and surveillance, climate hazards proofing, and sacred dimensions. The findings of this study show that it is possible to address challenges confronting Africa's urban biodiversity through the combination of scientific and indigenous systems.

T2  - Ecological Economics
AB  - Residential landscapes with private gardens are major land covers in cities and their sustainable management is paramount for achieving a resilient urban future. Here we focus on the value of residential ecosystems for biodiversity conservation and explore the social and ecological factors that influence wildlife-friendly garden management. Using a stratified sampling design across the UK city of Leeds, this interdisciplinary study develops and applies a mixed method approach, including questionnaires, interviews and ecological surveys across multiple spatial scales. We quantify wildlife-friendly gardening using two measures: (i) the number of wildlife-friendly features within gardens (the wildlife resources index, WRI); and (ii) the frequency of winter bird feeding. Wildlife-friendly gardening is influenced by a combination of garden characteristics and management intensity, householder demographics, wider environmental activity and landscape context. Residents reveal a range of motivations for wildlife-friendly gardening, notably personal well-being and a moral responsibility to nature. Respondents expressed a duty to maintain neighbourhood standards, revealing that social norms are a considerable barrier to uptake of wildlife-friendly activities, but also provide an opportunity where neighbour mimicry results in diffusion of wildlife-friendly practices. Community-driven initiatives that engage, educate and empower residents are better placed to encourage wildlife-friendly gardening than top-down financial incentives.

T2  - Sustainability Science
AB  - Cultural landscapes generate many ecological values. Much of the cultural landscape exists as private or semi-private domestic gardens. These domestic gardens are hidden treasures of information on small-scale urban landscape design, urban biodiversity and the relation between citizens and their direct living environments. In this paper, an indicator framework is proposed that aims to engage citizens in experiencing and exploring biodiversity and ecosystem services in their own domestic outdoor spaces. By integrating ecological and cultural factors related to garden biodiversity the framework intends to fill a gap in existing research on domestic gardens that has until now either focused on ecological factors, or on preferences of garden owners. The framework has been developed by analysing pictures of front-yards in Phoenix (AZ, USA) and Maastricht (the Netherlands). With the BIMBY [Biodiversity in My (Back) Yard] framework we aim to contribute to an inclusive trans-disciplinary and transformational dialogue on ecosystem services, green infrastructure and biodiversity conservation in the context of the sustainable development of cities.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Polycentric governance and stakeholder participation in natural resource management have potential benefits for both human and environmental well-being. Researchers and decision-makers have attempted to conceptualise the ecological, social and political potential of such semi-formal approaches to urban green space management. However, few studies have quantified the actual benefits in terms of biodiversity and associated ecosystem service provision, or the factors that mediate levels of participation. The links between biodiversity potential, site access and user participation were explored in a case study comprising ten established examples of organised social-ecological initiatives in the inner-city area of Greater Manchester. At the micro-scale, the case study quantified the levels of community involvement (measured in volunteer hours month(-1)) in local green commons and the biodiversity potential (assessed using floristic and structural diversity as a surrogate) of the ten sites. Descriptive analysis identified that site spatial and design characteristics affected all three measures and subsequent correlational analyses revealed a high degree of synergy between site use and biodiversity. The study thereby provides quantitative evidence of the synergistic relationship between green space use and urban biodiversity and, importantly, the positive feedbacks which should result between volunteer input and the local generation of ecosystem services. The study provides support for the promotion of a highly decentralised, stakeholder-led stewardship of green space as a valid consideration in the management of urban ecosystem services.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - Context The conservation value of residential landscapes is becoming increasingly apparent in our urbanizing world. The ecological characteristics of residential areas are largely determined by the decisions of many individual "managers." In these complex socio-ecological systems, it is important to understand the factors that motivate human decision-making. Objectives Our first objective was to quantify wildlife resources and management activities in residential landscapes and compare vegetation in front and back yards. Our second objective was to test three hypotheses linked with variation in yards socioeconomic characteristics, neighborhood design factors, and perceptions of neighborhood birds. Methods We conducted surveys of over 900 residents in 25 Chicago-area neighborhoods to examine the wildlife resources contained in front and back yards and the social factors associated with variation in yards. We used a multi-scalar approach to examine among-yard and among-neighborhood variation in residential landscapes. Results Results indicate that back yards contain more wildlife resources than front yards, including greater vegetation complexity, more plants with fruit/berries, and more plants intended to attract birds. Furthermore, different hypotheses explain variation in front and back yards. Perceptions of birds were most important in explaining variation in back yard vegetation and wildlife-friendly resources per parcel, while neighbors' yards and socioeconomic characteristics best explained front yard vegetation. Conclusions This study demonstrates the importance of back yards as an unexplored and underestimated resource for biodiversity. In addition, the results provide insight into the complex factors linked with yard decisions, notably that residents' connections with neighborhood birds appear to translate to on-the-ground actions.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Large parts of urban space around the world exist of small-scale plots such as domestic gardens. These small-scale urban spaces carry potential for enhancing biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services in and beyond cities. However, domestic gardening and residential garden designs are often guided by aesthetics and ease more than by the aim to create habitat and biological diversity. Yard-management decisions impact socio-ecological systems in various ways, for example through irrigation patterns, fertilization or the use of pesticides or through the choice for exotic species that may become invasive over time. Yard-management decisions can also positively influence the presence of pollinators, improve soil quality or even foster small scale 'Wildlife Habitats' that can function as ecological stepping stones to the wider environment. In this paper a pilot assessment is presented of the contribution of residential front-yards in Phoenix (Arizona) and Maastricht (The Netherlands) to biodiversity, ecosystem services and sustainability by applying the BIMBY (Biodiversity in My (Back) Yard) framework.

AB  - Collective management of urban green space is being acknowledged and promoted. The need to understand productivity and potential trade-offs between co-occurring ecosystem services arising from collectively managed pockets of green space is pivotal to the design and promotion of both productive urban areas and effective stakeholder participation in their management. Quantitative assessments of ecosystem service production were obtained from detailed site surveys at ten examples of collectively managed urban gardens in Greater Manchester, UK. Correlation analyses demonstrated high levels of synergy between ecological (biodiversity) and social (learning and well-being) benefits related to such spaces. Trade-offs were highly mediated by site size and design, resulting in a tension between increasing site area and the co-management of ecosystem services. By highlighting synergies, trade-offs and the significance of site area, the results offer insight into the spatially sensitive nature of ecosystem services arising from multi-functional collectively managed urban gardens.

TI  - Contrasting effects of visiting urban green-space and the countryside on biodiversity knowledge and conservation support
AU  - Coldwell, Deborah F.
AU  - Evans, Karl L.
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Conservation policy frequently assumes that increasing people's exposure to green-space enhances their knowledge of the natural world and desire to protect it. Urban development is, however, considered to be driving declining connectedness to nature. Despite this the evidence base supporting the assumption that visiting green-spaces promotes biodiversity knowledge and conservation support, and the impacts of urbanization on these relationships, is surprisingly limited. Using data from door-to-door surveys of nearly 300 residents in three pairs of small and large urban areas in England we demonstrate that people who visit green-space more regularly have higher biodiversity knowledge and support for conservation (measured using scales of pro-environmental behavior). Crucially these relationships only arise when considering visits to the countryside and not the frequency of visits to urban green-space. These patterns are robust to a suite of confounding variables including nature orientated motivations for visiting green-space, socio-economic and demographic factors, garden-use and engagement with natural history programs. Despite this the correlations that we uncover cannot unambiguously demonstrate that visiting the countryside improves biodiversity knowledge and conservation support. We consider it likely, however, that two mechanisms operate through a positive feedback loop i.e. increased visits to green-space promote an interest in and knowledge of biodiversity and support for conservation, which in turn further increase the desire to visit green-space and experience nature. The intensity of urbanization around peoples' homes, but not city size, is negatively associated with their frequency of countryside visits and biodiversity knowledge. Designing less intensely urbanized cities with good access to the countryside, combined with conservation policies that promote access to the countryside thus seems likely to maximize urban residents' biodiversity knowledge and support for conservation.

AU  - Beumer, Carijn
T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - This paper focuses on Dutch perspectives on the issue of gardening for biodiversity and sustainable urban environments. A semi-qualitative survey based on multiple choice, open, and visual questions were conducted with a representative sample of the Dutch population (N = 517). The aim of the survey was to get a better insight into the way Dutch domestic gardens contribute to urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation. Cultural Theory was used as a heuristic framework for survey design and analysis. The results show that the Dutch population is best represented by the Egalitarian and the Hierarchist perspectives. The Egalitarian perspective has strong ecological ideals, but these ideals are not reflected in how most of them design and maintain their gardens in practice. There seems to be a strong cognitive dissonance in the relation between a majority of the Dutch garden owners and the design and maintenance of their gardens. Only a small group of people with an Autonomous perspective is able to bring their high ecological ideals into practice in their yards. The Individualist perspective group has least ideological and practical concern for gardening, sustainability and biodiversity. The results have been discussed in the context of global goals for sustainable cities and biodiversity, as reflected in the Aichi targets and the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper intends to provide policymakers and urban planners with levers to experiment with incentives to bridge gaps between private space and public interests (the public/private dilemma).

AB  - Policies to move us towards livable, sustainable cities need involvement and support from urban societies. For children in particular, as future players in urban development, experiences in nature provide a basis for further interactions with nature and increase awareness of environmental issues. However, children are spending less and less time in nature, which threatens the development of environmentally aware behavior and can have negative health impacts. Schools are critical for environmental education, and there is a long tradition of schools serving as sites of food production and consumption, although consideration of biodiversity is often absent. We argue here for a concept of "biodiverse edible schools" that link food production and consumption with local biodiversity. This increases opportunities for children to better understand both urban nature and healthy food. We highlight the role of edible wild plants as a promising vector for coupling the usually distinct fields of food and biodiversity in the daily life of students. Using a case study from Berlin, Germany, we illustrate how stakeholders from different spheres can work together to bring critical components of biodiverse edible schools to reality. The components of our project include (1) a school kitchen supplied with food from regional producers; (2) a garden on the school's grounds for producing food; (3) a neighboring vacant wild site as a habitat for wild edible plants, and, most importantly, (4) collaborative activities in planning, managing, and using the garden and the wild site. This case study demonstrates opportunities and challenges for policies aimed at strengthening the bonds between children and nature, helping them better understand food production, and improving their diet. The concept of biodiverse edible schools highlights promising functions of wild urban land as an informal component of urban green infrastructure that can jointly support cultural and provisioning ecosystem services in cities.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Domestic ('private') gardens constitute a substantial proportion of 'green space' in urban areas and hence are of potential significance for the maintenance of biodiversity in such areas. However, the size and nature of this resource and its associated features are poorly known. In this study, we provide the first detailed audit, using domestic gardens in the city of Sheffield as a model study system. Domestic gardens, the mean area of which was 151 m(2), cover approximately 33 km(2) or 23% of the predominantly urban area of the city. The smaller gardens contribute disproportionately to this total because, although individually they add little, they are large in number. Conversely, the regions of the city with proportionately more garden area contribute most to the total garden area of the city, although such regions are limited in number. Based on the findings of a telephone based survey, 14.4% of dwellings with gardens were estimated to have ponds, 26% to have nest-boxes, 29% to have compost heaps, 48% to hold trees more than 3 m tall, and 14% of dwellings were estimated to be home to one or more cats. Whilst the absolute frequency of these features is low to moderate, by extrapolation they nonetheless yield estimates for domestic gardens in Sheffield of a total of 25,200 ponds, 45,500 nest boxes, 50,750 compost heaps, 360,000 trees, and a population of 52,000 domestic cats. These results are considered in the context of the role of gardens in urban areas as habitats for wildlife and the implications for housing policy.

T2  - Environmental Management
AB  - Domestic gardens make substantial contributions to the provision of green space in urban areas. However, the ecological functions provided by such gardens depend critically on their configuration and composition. Here, we present the first detailed analysis of variation in the composition of urban gardens, in relation to housing characteristics and the nature of the surrounding landscape, across different cities in the United Kingdom. In all five cities studied (Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leicester, and Oxford), garden size had an overwhelming influence on garden composition. Larger gardens supported more of the land-use types recorded, in greater extents, and were more likely to contain particular features, including tall trees and mature shrubs, areas of unmown grass and uncultivated land, vegetable patches, ponds, and composting sites. The proportional contribution of non-vegetated land-uses decreased as garden area increased. House age was less significant in determining the land-use within gardens, although older houses, which were more likely to be found further from the urban edge of the city, contained fewer hedges and greater areas of vegetation canopy > 2 m in height. Current UK government planning recommendations will ultimately reduce the area of individual gardens and are thus predicted to result in fewer tall trees and, in particular, less vegetation canopy > 2 m. This might be detrimental from ecological, aesthetic, social, and economic stand points.

AB  - Spatial data are considered to be an essential entry point to get domestic gardens on the agendas of land use monitoring, spatial planning and environmental policies. As a green facet of urbanization, gardens cover a substantial part of land all over the world. Moreover, domestic gardens deliver several ecosystem services. The sustainability turn in planning however focuses on densification. In densification scenarios, planners could consider domestic garden area as a land reserve. Yet, due to a lack of data they would be ill-informed on the domestic garden services and potentials and not be able to make well-founded choices. So, the strategic value of domestic gardens remains largely unquestioned. By developing and applying a mixed methodology that combines an existing land use map with empirical data, this study provides data and insights on the spatial coverage, distribution and growth of domestic garden area in Flanders (the northern region of Belgium). The results show that 8% of the Flemish area is covered by domestic gardens, as well as 21% of the total area of Flemish residential cores. The highest concentrations are found in pen-urban areas and around ribbon developments. About 8% of the garden area that existed in the period 2002-2005 was new compared to the period 1988-1990 and occupied mainly former agricultural land (90%). The results clarify the regional significance of domestic gardens in terms of spatial coverage. The developed mixed methodology made the domestic garden theme analysable. The insights offer an entry point for a debate on the strategic value of domestic gardens.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Planning and Management
AB  - While claims about the environmental benefits of community gardens abound, few researchers have systematically assessed the ecological integrity of gardening practices. This study investigated gardening practices in 50 community gardens in Brisbane and Gold Coast cities, Australia. The study aimed to better understand how gardening practices might affect the ecological viability of community gardens. Factors investigated included garden bio-physical characteristics, operators' motivations, gardeners' socio-demographic backgrounds, garden facilities and types of plants grown. Two broad types of gardens were identified permaculture (21 gardens) and non-permaculture (29 gardens). Permaculture gardens used lower-impact gardening practices. Findings have policy implications for environmental planning and management.

TI  - Site-specific factors in the production of local urban ecosystem services A case study of community-managed green space
AU  - Dennis, Matthew

T2  - Ecosystem Services
AB  - Pockets of green space in cities can provide important ecosystem services for urban residents. As naturalistic spaces in urban areas become increasingly sparse, communities are beginning to co-manage existing incidental pockets of land towards the creation of communal natural resources. Such green commons can be productive in terms of ecosystem services through targeted management such as in the case of urban agriculture. Although some work has been done to explore the motives behind and potential benefits of informal green space management, further research is required to understand those characteristics of site management and community input which contribute to the enhancement of site specific ecosystem service production. A case study of ten examples of community-managed green space was undertaken to evaluate the contributory factors relating to site character and management which influenced productivity as defined by the cumulative provision of four urban-relevant ecosystem services. The analysis revealed that the level of community involvement, measured as intensity of volunteer hours, was highly instrumental in the productivity of sites. Food production also proved to be catalytic for the enhancement of ecosystem services whereas extent of vegetative cover and increasing site size were, counter-intuitively, detrimental to overall site productivity. The study therefore supports the promotion of participatory approaches to the management of ecosystems services in urban areas, particularly those which take small-scale urban agriculture as a primary practice.

AU  - Collas, Lydia

AU  - Balmford, Andrew
T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - 1. At present, there is limited knowledge of how best to reconcile urban development with biodiversity conservation, and in particular whether populations of wild species would be greater under low-density housing (with larger gardens), or high-density housing (allowing more area to be left as undeveloped green spaces). The land sharing/sparing framework - originally developed in the context of farming - can be applied to address this question. 2. We sampled the abundance of trees in the city of Cambridge, UK, along a gradient of human density. We designed different scenarios of urban growth to accommodate the human population predicted in 2031. For each scenario, we projected the future city-wide tree population size and quantified its carbon sequestration potential. We also considered, for the first time in an urban sharing-sparing context, the implications of habitat restoration on degraded urban green space. 3. We found that the density of most native and non-native tree species is presently highest in areas of low human density, compared to both higher density areas and green space (which is largely maintained with few trees). However, restoring woodland in green spaces would lead to far greater densities of native trees than on any existing land use. Hence, provided >2% of green space is restored, native tree population sizes would be larger if urban growth followed a land-sparing approach. Likewise, carbon sequestration would be maximised under land sparing coupled with restoration, but even so only a maximum of 2.5% of the city's annual greenhouse gas emissions could be offset. 4. Although both tree populations and carbon storage thus appear to benefit from land-sparing development, the risk that this might widen the existing disconnect between people and nature must also be addressed - perhaps through a combination of adding housing in low-density areas while ensuring these are in close proximity to high-quality green space. 5. Synthesis and applications. In regions which have already been cleared of intact habitat, a combination of land-sparing urban development with the restoration of green space could accommodate urban population growth whilst dramatically improving the existing status of local tree populations. Where cities are expanding into intact habitat, the merits of urban development by land sparing may be even more pronounced. Studies in such regions are urgently needed.

TI  - Australian brush-turkeys in a suburban environment - implications for conflict and conservation
AU  - Jones, Darryl N.
AU  - Everding, Susanne E.
T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Although frequently reported from within the Brisbane city boundaries, the range of the Australian brush-turkey, Alectura lathami, was limited mainly to forested areas adjacent to suburban areas. Since the early 1970s, however, the species' presence in the suburbs has increased steadily and it is now common in many suburbs. Destruction and disruption of gardens during the construction of incubation mounds has led to a significant conflict with householders. This study found the species to be most abundant in suburbs adjacent to forest reserves and major watercourses. A number of extremely isolated populations were also identified. Although suburban mounds contained similar numbers of eggs as mounds from the wild, suburban mounds were more prone to failure, probably due to the use of inappropriate mound materials. Despite some evidence of increasing spread within the suburbs, the long-term survival of the species is seriously threatened by hatchling predation and continued loss of habitat.

TI  - 'Functional groups' of bird species, biodiversity and landscapes in Scotland
AU  - French, D D

T2  - Journal of Biogeography
AB  - Aims To define, objectively, a comprehensive set of functional groups of bird species in Scotland, taking into account season and spatial scale; to use these groups to assess how functional biodiversity of Scottish birds is related to land cover/use patterns. Location Scotland. Methods Analyses were of all bird species (resident or migrant) present in Scotland, excluding only the rarest and seabirds which come ashore only to breed, at both individual territory ('functional Groups')and landscape ('Landscape Clusters') scales, separately for summer and winter, using data covering the whole of Scotland. Functional Groups were defined by species' use of a large number of habitat features for feeding, nesting, roosting/perching and cover/shelter. Landscape Clusters were derived from the strength of species' associations with six land cover/use strata arable (cropped land), inbye (controlled/managed grasslands), mooredge (mixed moorland/non-moorland landscape), moor (large areas of essentially uninterrupted moorland), plateau (areas containing the highest or most climatically severe moorland or montane land) and non-agricultural (principally urban areas, large forest blocks and large water bodies). Bird species and Functional Groups were related to landscape-scale land cover/use by their associations with strata. Biodiversity patterns in relation to land cover/use were similarly examined both as species diversity and Functional Group diversity. Results Both Functional Groups and Landscape Clusters were clearly interpretable ecologically. Species within Functional Groups had consistent patterns of association with strata, linking birds with land cover/use at landscape as well as local habitat scale. However, Landscape Clusters showed several differences from Functional Groups, mainly linked with the relative importance of 'local' and landscape-scale habitat features, or limited geographical range of some species. While there were clear groupings of species related to land cover/use in summer, bird distributions in winter were primarily related to climate severity, with broad land cover/use of only secondary importance. Bird biodiversity varied functionally as well as numerically between strata. Variation between strata was consistent with the habitat-use characteristics of each Functional Group. Limited geographical range of some species reduced the per-square species richness of all Functional Groups below their potential maximum but the degree of reduction varied markedly between Functional Groups. Structural heterogeneity in the landscape was an important determinant of bird biodiversity, with both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape types (strata) of value to different Functional Groups. The importance of the lowland strata for birds generally, especially in winter, contrasted with the specific importance of every stratum for particular Functional Groups, especially in summer. Conclusions The combination of Functional Groups and land cover/use stratification enables a concise, comprehensive, direct assessment of bird biodiversity in relation to land cover/use at landscape scale. It also provides a framework within which effects of regional or global changes in environment or land use on bird biodiversity can be estimated. Total species richness in a stratum is a poor measure of its importance for overall bird biodiversity; species richness within Functional Groups, together with the analyses of Functional Groups in relation to the strata, provides a better base for the formulation of national-level conservation and biodiversity policy.

T2  - Environmental Management
AB  - Fluctuations of bird abundances in the Midwest region of the United States have been attributed to such factors as landscape change, habitat fragmentation, depredation, and supplemental feeding. However, no attempt has been made to estimate the collective role of landowner activities that may influence birds across a landscape. To investigate how landowners might influence birds when the majority (> 90%) of land is privately owned, we surveyed all 1694 private domestic landowners living on three breeding bird survey routes (similar to 120 km) that represent a continuum of rural-to-urban landscapes in Southeastern Michigan from October through December 2000. Our survey was designed to investigate (1) the proportion of landowners involved in bird feeding, providing bird houses, planting or maintaining vegetation for birds, gardening, landscaping, applying fertilizer, and applying pesticides or herbicides; (2) whether differences existed between urban, suburban, and rural landowner activities; and (3) whether landowners that carried out a given activity were sociodemographically different from those who did not. Of the 968 respondents (58.5% response rate), 912 (94%) carried out at least one of the activities on their land and the average landowner carried out 3.7 activities. A total of 65.6% fed birds, 45.7% provided bird houses, 54.6% planted or maintained vegetation for birds, 72.7% gardened, 72.3% landscaped, 49.3% applied fertilizer, and 25.2% applied pesticides or herbicides. Significant differences existed between the landscapes, with rural landowners having more bird houses and applying pesticides or herbicides in greater frequency. Similarly, urban landowners had a greater density of bird feeders and houses, but planted or maintained vegetation in the lowest frequency. Participation in activities varied by demographic factors, such as age, gender, and occupation. Scaling each activity to all landowners, including nonrespondents, across all landscapes indicates that between 14% and 82% of landowners may be engaged in a particular activity, with application of pesticides or herbicides having the least potential involvement (13.9%-55.4%) and gardening having the greatest potential involvement (40.1%-81.6%). Taken collectively, our results indicate that landowners are both intentionally and unintentionally engaged in a wide range of activities that are likely to influence bird populations.

T2  - Ecography
AB  - Habitat associations of 40 bird species were analysed using data from a survey of 12892 garden sites throughout the United Kingdom between 1995 and 2002. Gradients in 20 garden habitat variables and 25 variables describing the surrounding local habitat were derived from Detrended Correspondence Analysis. The main garden axis explained 13.3% of variation in the data and described a gradient from sites containing and bounded by high levels of vegetation cover to open sites bounded by walls and fences. The main local axis explained 29.9% of variation in the data and described a gradient from rural to urban habitats. Higher probability of occurrence was detected in larger sites in 25 species and in smaller sites in four (urban-associated) species. Many species (22 out of 40) were significantly associated with the local gradient seven species showed the highest probability of occurrence in sites within more urbanised habitats. Other species were most likely to occur in sites within rural or suburban habitats. Only five species showed a significant association with garden habitat gradient, four of these being most likely to occur in sites with highest vegetation cover. These associations were similar when controlling for garden size and for food provision in gardens. The results imply that the likelihood of many species occurring in gardens is dependent on the surrounding local habitat rather than the garden habitat. However, survey participants were likely to have "bird-friendly" gardens which may have reduced the variation in garden habitat across the sample. An assessment of the representativeness of survey sites is needed to further understand habitat associations of garden birds.

T2  - Bird Study
AB  - Capsule More birds breed in gardens than previous estimates suggest. Aims To determine the numbers of birds nesting on or in houses and gardens in Great Britain. Methods A questionnaire survey of 12 687 households in Great Britain was conducted in 2000, of which 6035 responded. A follow-up survey, to which 1757 responded, showed that people with no nests on their properties had been less likely to respond in the initial survey than had those with nests; it allowed this bias to be corrected. Sampling intensity differed regionally and by house-type (detached, semidetached, terraced); national population estimates were corrected to allow for this. The analysis was restricted to the 17 species that nested most frequently in domestic properties and to four others. Results It is likely that our estimates were somewhat too high for ten of the species. Even allowing for this, it is clear that the number of birds nesting in built-up areas is substantially higher than previously estimated for 13 of the 2 1 species. For some of these species, this has led in the past to significant underestimation of the total British population. Conclusions For some of the commonest British birds, accurate estimates of national populations are only possible if we get better estimates of numbers nesting in built-up areas than we have had in the past.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - A lack of food resources is often used as a reason for the decline in native birds in cities. This study investigated the use of exotic and native nectar resources by the nectarivore guild of birds, which often forms a major component of suburban bird communities in Australia. We investigated the food resource (nectar volume, concentration and sugar reward) of two common native and two exotic garden plant genera. We also determined the relative preference of the nectarivorous bird community for native and exotic plants and examined the relationship between nectarivore foraging preferences and particular garden characteristics. Banksias and grevilleas (native genera) produced significantly higher volumes of nectar than camellias and hibiscus (exotic genera) per floral unit, per plant and per cubic metre of foliage. Banksias also produced significantly more concentrated nectar and consequently a higher sugar reward per floral unit than the other three genera. Fourteen bird species were recorded using the study plants, although only three species were commonly observed feeding the Red Wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Little Wattlebird (Anthochaera chrysoptera) and Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala). Banksia and grevillea plants were preferred by all bird species, which spent significantly more time in banksia than in any other genus. Other variables influencing the time birds spent in a plant were the number of floral units per plant and the number of banksia and callistemon plants present in the garden. Overall, the native genera, banksia and grevillea were not only a more valuable source of food than the exotic genera, camellia and hibiscus, but they were also the preferred foraging sites for suburban nectarivorous birds. Whether the surplus of nectar from native shrubs is associated with territories of larger and aggressive honeyeaters competitively excluding small birds from gardens, is an important research agenda for understanding these urban bird communities.

AB  - 1. Wild birds are commonly observed in private residential gardens in Great Britain. However, little is known about how their use of this significant and increasingly important habitat is changing and how such changes relate to their population status. 2. Trends in the use of private residential gardens by wild birds in Great Britain were investigated using weekly bird records from 18 300 gardens over 8 years. 3. We showed that the use of this habitat is seasonal and cyclic, with the timing and regularity of its periodicity variable between species. 4. We evaluated the significance of the underlying trends in the cyclic reporting rates. Eighteen species showed clear trends, the three with the most negative year term parameter estimates being 'red-listed' as high conservation concern. 5. Examining correlations with national scale survey data suggested that garden reporting rates are related to general population trends in a number of species, including several of conservation importance. Other species exhibit important differences between national and garden trends. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis demonstrates ecologically meaningful trends and provides novel insights into seasonal cycles of habitat exploitation, using relatively simple and cost-effectively collected data. This will lead to greater understanding of the relationships between gardens and general bird populations and of the times of year at which garden habitats are most important for birds. We have demonstrated the practicality and productivity of 'citizen science' in this context, and provided new information on the status of some birds of conservation concern.

T2  - Revista de Biología Tropical
AB  - This study deals with the time-activity budgets of Amazilia amazilia, a territorial hummingbird, and its preferences for different flower species and perches in the gardens of Lima (Peru) in September 2001. A. amazilia spent an important part of its time resting on perches (ca. 80%) and only 15.5% for foraging, devoted essentially to flower visitation and only 0.3% for hunting and drinking water. Territorial defence accounted for 2% of total time, mostly against Coereba flaveola, an introduced nectarivorous species that seem to be an important competitor of A. amazilia. Flower use is not directly related to flower abundance (chi(2)(9) = 1 546, p < 0.0001), with Justicia brandegeana and red-flowered Salvia splendens being selected and Impatiens balsamina being rejected. The large amount of time spent on the perches makes them an important element of the habitat. The perches selected are typically on trees, close to the flowers visited, and in a low vertical and middle horizontal position, surrounded by low foliage density, probably to minimize heat loss.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Can enhancement of garden habitat for native birds have conservation benefits, or are garden bird assemblages determined by landscape and environmental characteristics? The relative roles of vegetation structure, floristics and other garden attributes, and environmental and landscape controls, on the abundance and richness of bird species in 214 back or front gardens in 10 suburbs of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, are addressed to answer this question. Birds were counted in each garden and the resources they utilized noted. Vascular plant species and other attributes of the garden were noted, along with rainfall, altitude, distance from natural vegetation, distance from the city and garden size. Garden floristics and bird assemblages were ordinated, and garden groups characterized by particular assemblages of birds identified. General linear modelling was used to determine the combinations of independent variables that best predicted the richness of birds and the abundance of individual bird species and groups of species. The models for bird richness, bird species and groups of bird species were highly individualistic. Although native birds showed a preference for native plants, they also utilized many exotic plants. Exotic birds largely utilized exotic plants. Variation in garden characteristics does substantially affect the nature of garden bird assemblages in Hobart, with weaker environmental and landscape influences. The fact that gardens can be designed and managed to favour particular species and species assemblages gives gardeners a potentially substantial role in the conservation of urban native avifauna.

AB  - Capsule Bird species richness showed consistent positive correlations with site area and rough grass. Aim To determine those features of parks and other public green spaces that are of most importance in promoting bird species richness and to use this information to make recommendations for management of these areas. Methods Birds were counted in parks and other public green spaces within Greater London. Three survey visits were made in each of the periods summer 2002 and 2003 and winter 2002/03 and 2003/04. Habitat data were also collected. Results Site area was the most consistently significant variable related (positively) to total species richness. There were also positive effects of waterbodies and rough grass (including nettles and weed-rich areas). Species richness increased with a greater proportion of adjacent gardens in sites < 1 ha in size. There were negative associations with the presence of buildings. When considered by species group (woodland species, farmland species and habitat generalists), results were very similar to those for total species richness, except that there were no significant associations with presence of waterbodies. Conclusion Bird species richness is likely to be enhanced by increasing site area, and providing rough gross and waterbodies in urban green spaces. Such information could be especially useful in designing green spaces in new residential developments to maximize avian diversity. Surrounding habitats are also crucial determinants of bird species richness in parks.

AB  - The 558 prey items brought home by one domestic cat, recorded over its 17-year lifetime, included 221 mice, 63 rats, 35 rabbits, 4 hares and 2 weasels. The cat hunted up to 600 m from the house, and prey was caught both inside and outside the 0.5 ha garden. Of the 223 birds brought in, 54 were native, including 43 silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis), but those killed were quickly replaced, so there was always a resident population of 1-2 pairs. The other known native birds comprised five fantails (Rhipidura fuliginosa), four warblers (Gerygone igata), a kingfisher (Halcyon sancta), and a shining cuckoo (Chrysococcyx lucidus). Only nine skinks (Cyclodina aenea) and one frog (Litoria raniformis) were brought in. The abundance of birds and reptiles in the garden showed no apparent change over the 17 years compared with the previous 15-year-period without a cat. By contrast, the cat exterminated the rabbit population in the garden, and "farmed" surrounding burrows during its whole life; all other prey killed declined in frequency after the cat was 8-9 years old.

T2  - Journal of Ornithology
AB  - The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is showing population declines in many parts of Europe, with recent declines being particularly severe in urban areas. To date, relatively little is known about the species' habitat associations within urbanized landscapes. We report here an investigation of the habitat associations of house sparrows using a survey of 1223 stratified randomly selected 500 x 500-m squares within urbanized landscapes of the UK, defined as at least 25% "human cover'. The densities of chirping male house sparrows and of all house sparrows were analysed separately to obtain insights into breeding habitat requirements and general habitat associations, respectively. Multi-model inference showed that residential areas (houses, flats), allotments (areas used for small-scale horticulture) and farm buildings were key predictors of house sparrow density and chirping male density. Separate analyses on landscapes of differing human cover showed similar results. Within residential areas, the increase of house sparrow density with habitat area (on a log scale) was approximately threefold greater when private gardens were present than when they were absent. The model predicted a rapid decline in house sparrow abundance when only a small area of private gardens is converted to continuous housing. Allotments and residential areas with gardens are likely to be under pressure due to increased demand for housing, specifically from the infilling of green space within urban areas. It would seem to be imperative that any action plan to protect urban house sparrow populations should include specific protection of such key habitats.

AB  - Households across the developed world cumulatively spend many millions of dollars annually on feeding garden birds. While beneficial effects on avian assemblages are frequently claimed, the relationships between levels of garden bird feeding and local avian populations are unknown. Using data from a large UK city, we show that both avian species richness and abundance vary across different socioeconomic neighbourhood types. We examined whether patterns in bird feeding could explain this variation. The density of bird feeding stations across the urban environment was strongly positively related to avian abundance, after controlling for differences in habitat availability. This effect was almost exclusively driven by the abundance of those species known to utilize garden feeding stations frequently. In contrast, the density of feeding stations had no effect on avian species richness. We also examined variation in the proportion of households in different communities that provide food for birds, a factor that is not correlated with feeder density. The prevalence of bird feeding across different neighbourhoods declined as socioeconomic deprivation increased, and increased with avian species richness and abundance. Our results suggest that the provision of supplementary food for birds by multiple landowners across a city can impact the status of urban bird populations. The potential for harnessing these actions for conservation needs to be explored.

AB  - Noisy Miners have been described as a 'reverse keystone' species, aggressively excluding many bird species from an ever-increasing range of human-dominated landscapes. Understanding the factors influencing the distribution of Noisy Miners is therefore an important research priority. To determine whether a relationship exists between the distribution of Noisy Miners and the vegetation composition of suburban gardens, birds were surveyed according to a factorial design defined by the presence or absence of grevilleas and eucalypts. Contrary to popular expectation, there was no significant association between the abundance of Noisy Miners and the presence of hybrid grevilleas. However, there was a highly significant relationship between the abundance of Noisy Miners and the presence of eucalypts. Analysis of foraging time budgets showed that Noisy Miners consistently spent 25-30% of their foraging time feeding on grevilleas (only in sites in which they were present). Similar amounts of time were spent foraging in eucalypts or in flowering callistemons (when available), and the presence of grevilleas did not result in a reduction in overall commitments to foraging. Noisy Miners also spent substantial amounts of time foraging on open ground. This study does not support the notion that hybrid grevilleas have played a causal role in the spread of Noisy Miners across many suburban areas of eastern Australia. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that it is the proliferation of lightly-treed open areas that favours the Noisy Miner.

AB  - The breeding success of blackbirds was investigated in April and June 2008 and 2009 in the Botanical Garden of the University of Pecs, with a total of 50 artificial nests at each of the four sessions (with 1 quail egg and 1 plasticine egg placed in every nest). In all four study periods of the two years, 2 nests (4%) were destroyed by predators. Six nests (12%, of the nests) were not discovered in either of the cases. The survival probability of artificial nests was greater in April than in June (both years), but the difference was significant only in 2008. Nests placed into a curtain of ivy (Hedera helix) on a wall were located higher up than those in bushes, yet their predation rates were quite similar. The predation values of quail vs. plasticine eggs did not differ in 2008. In the year 2009, however, significantly more quail eggs were discovered (mostly removed), than plasticine eggs. Marks that were left on plasticine eggs originated mostly from small mammals and small-bodied birds, but the disappearance of a large number of quail and plasticine eggs was probably caused by larger birds, primarily jays.

AB  - Capsule Different urban breeding bird communities are associated with different habitat types, but, although community species diversity varies significantly, total bird density does not. Aims To investigate the association between breeding bird communities and habitats within Bristol, UK and how these communities vary in terms of species diversity and total bird abundance. Methods Breeding density data for 70 species in the metropolitan area of Bristol, UK were subjected to de-trended correspondence analysis to identify the number of different communities present and their indicator species. These data were then used to identify patterns of habitat association with each community and differences in species richness and total bird density. Results Three communities were identified a rural community associated with woodland, managed grassland and inland water; a suburban community associated with buildings and residential gardens; and an intermediate community that shared some of these habitat characteristics. Species richness, but not total bird abundance, was lowest in the suburban community. Conclusion The diversity of species in urban areas appears to be most dependent upon the availability of patches of natural and semi-natural habitats. Residential gardens support fewer species, but those species that are present may be found at high densities.

AB  - We compared the pronounced geographic pattern in the recolonization of Britain by the Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) from 1970 onward with the spatiotemporal pattern among House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) populations over the same period, using data on the occurrence of both species at garden feeding stations. Using a simulation of House Sparrow population trends based on a logistic model that incorporated a predation index derived from Eurasian Sparrowhawk incidence functions, we generated a close approximation to the unique trajectories among House Sparrow populations in rural and urban sites in different regions of Britain. We carried out further comparisons using two contrasting methods that focused solely on temporal patterns. We used estimates of the varying date of Eurasian Sparrowhawk recolonization at different sites to derive time variables in relation to recolonization date. One such relative time variable proved to be a better predictor of House Sparrow numbers than chronological time; it indicated that House Sparrow numbers were generally stable or increasing prior to recolonization by Eurasian Sparrowhawks but declined continuously afterward. We also detected a significantly greater decrease in House Sparrow numbers when Eurasian Sparrowhawks were present using a method that compared annual changes in the abundance of prey species in the presence or absence of a predator. On the basis of these results, we argue that predation by Eurasian Sparrowhawks may be a sufficient explanation for the decline in House Sparrows in Britain. We also argue that urban House Sparrow populations' long-term release from predator pressure made them especially vulnerable when urban habitats were colonized by Eurasian Sparrowhawks.

AB  - The Rose-ringed parakeet Psittacula krameri, a bird species of subtropical origin, has established feral populations in temperate Europe. We analysed the feeding habits of Rose-ringed parakeets near Paris, France, in order to assess if food provided by humans might contribute to the success of this invasive bird species. We considered 87 feeding events performed during 2002 - 2007 and 247 feeding events performed during March - November 2008. We recorded the consumption of seeds, buds and fruits from many native and introduced shrubs and trees, and the use of bird feeders in private and public gardens throughout the year. We followed four radio-equipped birds for 150 hours during September - December 2008, which spent about half of their feeding time at bird feeders. This confirmed the importance of bird feeders in the diet of the Rose-ringed parakeet. Our study underlines the opportunistic granivorous-frugivorous character of this parakeet species and the possible role of human food sources in the success of its establishment in many cities across temperate Europe.

Birdwatching is an important leisure activity, yet there appear to be no previous studies that combine these two themes of importance to the understanding of managed garden spaces. Semi-structured interviews were held with birdwatchers as part of a larger study of the interactions between local places and birdwatching. Respondents revealed a wide and disparate spectrum of responses to their gardens and to how they made use of their gardens in their normal birdwatching activities. The study raises questions about the extent to which gardens are viewed as sites for interactions with nature and raises challenges about the use of gardens as areas of conservation action.

T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain landscape designs outperform others in the support of native biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife, could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition, many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors, landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50% of the variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that support the well-being of both birds and people.

AB  - We compared the feeding behaviour of garden birds in the presence of four heterospecific decoy species at suburban feeding stations to assess the relative importance of body size (large vs. small) and demeanour (high vs. low potential for inter-specific aggression) as cues for threat recognition. We conducted separate trials with live, caged Australian magpie, Cracticus tibicen, and common myna, Acridotheres tristis, large and small species known to chase and harass heterospecifics, and comparably sized species not known for inter-species aggression (i.e. rock dove, Columba livia, and ringneck dove, Streptopelia risoria). Birds of all species arrived at feeding stations sooner and displayed higher-risk activities in the presence of small decoys. The two most common species that visited the feeding stations, silvereye, Zosterops lateralis, and house sparrow, Passer domesticus, were most likely to perform high-risk behaviours (i.e. landing on the stimulus cage and feeding from the station) in the presence of common mynas. The activities were performed least frequently in the presence of Australian magpies. As garden birds likely had the most experience interacting with common mynas, the results suggest that a two-step decision rule, with size and familiarity as important cues, may be used to recognize potential threats.

AB  - Residential yards comprise a substantial portion of urban landscapes, and the collective effects of the management of many individual yards may scale up to affect urban biodiversity. We conducted bird surveys and social surveys in Chicago-area (Illinois, USA) residential neighborhoods to identify the relative importance of yard design and management activities for native birds. We found that groups of neighboring yards, in the aggregate, were more important for native bird species richness than environmental characteristics at the neighborhood or landscape scale. The ratio of evergreen to deciduous trees in yards and the percentage of yards with trees and plants with fruits or berries were positively associated with native bird species richness, whereas the number of outdoor cats had a negative association. The number of birdfeeders was not an important predictor for native species richness. We also found that migratory birds were observed on transects with more wildlife-friendly features in yards, and nonnative birds were observed on transects with greater numbers of outdoor cats and dogs. Our results highlight the potential importance of residential matrix management as a conservation strategy in urban areas.

AB  - The practice of feeding wild birds is a widespread phenomenon, but there has been little consideration of both human and ecological dimensions of the impacts. We used a comprehensive approach to investigate the practice of bird feeding in the unique avian landscape of New Zealand. We quantified the practice and motivations of bird feeding via a nationwide postal survey, and identified ecological risks from current feeding practices. Our study confirmed that, as in many northern hemisphere countries, bird feeding is a common activity in New Zealand, with an estimated 46.6% of households feeding birds. Increased age and dog ownership were strongly associated with participation. Bread was most commonly provided; we estimated 5.1 million loaves/annum across the population of 1.8 million in six surveyed cities. The principal potential risk identified was that introduced birds are likely to be the main consumers of supplementary food sources in New Zealand, which may have follow-on effects for avian community composition. Disease transmission risks were also identified, with poor hygiene practices reported by many respondents. However, the social benefits to humans of feeding birds were strongly reflected in the motivations of the respondents. Over half fed birds because it brought them pleasure. As urbanisation increases globally, opportunities for connecting with nature decrease. Therefore, experiences such as bird feeding that increase the interaction between people and wildlife could be a powerful tool for fostering environmental awareness and guardianship. Our study highlights that without information about ecological consequences, humans may inadvertently make harmful choices for wildlife, so we recommend promulgation of appropriate guidelines to minimise the risks.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Interacting with nature is widely recognised as providing many health and well-being benefits. As people live increasingly urbanised lifestyles, the provision of food for garden birds may create a vital link for connecting people to nature and enabling them to access these benefits. However, it is not clear which factors determine the pleasure that people receive from watching birds at their feeders. These may be dependent on the species that are present, the abundance of individuals and the species richness of birds around the feeders. We quantitatively surveyed urban households from towns in southern England to determine the factors that influence the likeability of 14 common garden bird species, and to assess whether people prefer to see a greater abundance of individuals or increased species richness at their feeders. There was substantial variation in likeability across species, with songbirds being preferred over non-songbirds. Species likeability increased for people who fed birds regularly and who could name the species. We found a strong correlation between the number of species that a person could correctly identify and how connected to nature they felt when they watched garden birds. Species richness was preferred over a greater number of individuals of the same species. Although we do not show causation this study suggests that it is possible to increase the well-being benefits that people gain from watching birds at their feeders. This could be done first through a human to bird approach by encouraging regular interactions between people and their garden birds, such as through learning the species names and providing food. Second, it could be achieved through a bird to human approach by increasing garden songbird diversity because the pleasure that a person receives from watching an individual bird at a feeder is dependent not only on its species but also on the diversity of birds at the feeder.

AB  - Food availability is a primary driver of avian population regulation. However, few studies have considered the effects of what is essentially a massive supplementary feeding experiment the practice of wild bird feeding. Bird feeding has been posited as an important factor influencing the structure of bird communities, especially in urban areas, although experimental evidence to support this is almost entirely lacking. We carried out an 18-mo experimental feeding study at 23 residential properties to investigate the effects of bird feeding on local urban avian assemblages. Our feeding regime was based on predominant urban feeding practices in our region. We used monthly bird surveys to compare avian community composition, species richness, and the densities of local species at feeding and nonfeeding properties. Avian community structure diverged at feeding properties and five of the commonest garden bird species were affected by the experimental feeding regime. Introduced birds particularly benefitted, with dramatic increases observed in the abundances of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis) in particular. We also found evidence of a negative effect on the abundance of a native insectivore, the grey warbler (Gerygone igata). Almost all of the observed changes did not persist once feeding had ceased. Our study directly demonstrates that the human pastime of bird feeding substantially contributes to the structure of avian community in urban areas, potentially altering the balance between native and introduced species.

AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

AU  - Connolly, Creighton
T2  - Geoforum
AB  - This paper is based on 6 months of ethnographic, multi-sited research in Malaysia, and investigates the relatively recent phenomenon of edible birds' nest farming in urban areas ('swiftlet farming'). Swiftlet farms are typically converted shophouses or other buildings which have been modified for the purpose of harvesting the nests of the Edible-nest Swiftlet (Aerodramus fuciphagus). I use the controversy over urban swiftlet farming in the Malaysian city of George Town, Penang, to examine discourses used by key stakeholders to shape debates over the place of non-human animals in cities. By considering everyday experiences of urban swiftlet farming, I explore how this burgeoning industry is perceived amongst residents, and how it is deemed to be (in)appropriate within the political, economic and cultural landscape of George Town. Yet, I also consider how farmers have sought to contest these discourses on ideological and normative grounds. In so doing, I place the cultural animal geographies literature in conversation with emergent literature on landscape and urban political ecology. Such a framing allows for a critical evaluation of the controversies surrounding this case, and their implications for human animal cohabitation in cities. The paper reflects on the implications of this case for how we regulate human-animal relations and live in contemporary cities, and the crucial role of animals in altering urban form, aesthetics and everyday life, particularly in non-Western contexts.

AB  - Private gardens provide habitat and resources for many birds living in human-dominated landscapes. While wild bird feeding is recognised as one of the most popular forms of human-wildlife interaction, almost nothing is known about the use of bird baths. This citizen science initiative explores avian assemblages at bird baths in private gardens in south-eastern Australia and how this differs with respect to levels of urbanisation and bioregion. Overall, 992 citizen scientists collected data over two, four-week survey periods during winter 2014 and summer 2015 (43% participated in both years). Avian assemblages at urban and rural bird baths differed between bioregions with aggressive nectar-eating species influenced the avian assemblages visiting urban bird baths in South Eastern Queensland, NSW North Coast and Sydney Basin while introduced birds contributed to differences in South Western Slopes, Southern Volcanic Plains and Victorian Midlands. Small honeyeaters and other small native birds occurred less often at urban bird baths compared to rural bird baths. Our results suggest that differences between urban versus rural areas, as well as bioregion, significantly influence the composition of avian assemblages visiting bird baths in private gardens. We also demonstrate that citizen science monitoring of fixed survey sites such as bird baths is a useful tool in understanding large-scale patterns in avian assemblages which requires a vast amount of data to be collected across broad areas.

AB  - The proliferation of artificial lighting at night is one of the key anthropogenic changes associated with urbanised areas as well as some non-urban areas. Disruption to natural light/ dark regimes can have considerable effects on the timing of different behaviours of birds, particularly during the breeding season. However, the effect of artificial lights on the timing of behaviours during winter has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that time partitioning of foraging can have implications for avian winter survival. In this study, we assess at a landscape scale during winter, whether birds arrive at feeding stations earlier in areas with increased levels of artificial lighting using data from a citizen science project. Arrival times of the ten most commonly recorded species were associated with a combination of the density of artificial lights, temperature, rainfall and urban land cover. We found no evidence that birds advance the onset of foraging in gardens with more artificial lights nearby; contrary to our prediction, birds generally arrived later into these areas. This is possibly a response to differences in food availability or predation risk in areas with more artificial lights. We conclude that artificial light at night may not be as important for driving the timing of foraging behaviour in winter as previously thought, but it remains to be seen whether this represents a missed opportunity to extend the foraging period or an adaptive response.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Private residential property occupies a major part of the urban land base, yet considerable potential remains for improving the ecological performance of private gardens and landscapes. Ecologically-oriented approaches to design of residential properties, however, are only valuable if they are compatible with private landowner interests and needs-otherwise they may never be implemented. Landscape designers would benefit from more comprehensive guidance for ecologically-oriented planting design that best fits within residential settings. This paper identifies plant-based design strategies that may improve avian species richness, reviews scientific literature supporting these options, and describes three years of structured design research to evaluate how these strategies can be compatible with the programmatic and aesthetic goals of residential landowners. We worked with three New York State communities beginning with a community/neighborhood-scale visioning and goal setting process and ending with parcel-scale landscape designs. The project, in total, developed residential landscape designs for 50 private properties, each incorporating urban ecological benefits in combination with the interests and needs of the owner. We share here a set of planting design strategies for enhancing avian habitat on residential private property generated during this process. They include planting strategies that a) contribute to landscape networks; b) build vegetative structure at sites; c) provide microrefugia; d) optimize forage resource availability; and e) enhance plant diversity. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of design results for the strategies is discussed.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - At a time of unprecedented biodiversity loss, researchers are increasingly recognizing the broad range of benefits provided to humankind by nature. However, as people live more urbanized lifestyles there is a progressive disengagement with the natural world that diminishes these benefits and discourages positive environmental behaviour. The provision of food for garden birds is an increasing global phenomenon, and provides a readily accessible way for people to counter this trend. Yet despite its popularity, quite why people feed birds remains poorly understood. We explore three loosely defined motivations behind bird feeding that it provides psychological benefits, is due to a concern about bird welfare, and/or is due to a more general orientation towards nature. We quantitatively surveyed households from urban towns in southern England to explore attitudes and actions towards garden bird feeding. Each household scored three Likert statements relating to each of the three motivations. We found that people who fed birds regularly felt more relaxed and connected to nature when they watched garden birds, and perceived that bird feeding is beneficial for bird welfare while investing time in minimising associated risks. Finally, feeding birds may be an expression of a wider orientation towards nature. Overall, we found that the feelings of being relaxed and connected to nature were the strongest drivers. As urban expansion continues both to threaten species conservation and to change peoples' relationship with the natural world, feeding birds may provide an important tool for engaging people with nature to the benefit of both people and conservation.

AB  - Despite the negative impacts of urbanisation, some species adapt to pressures of habitat loss and fragmentation. Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator are a large avian forest frugivore that uses urban environments in South Africa. Consequently, we used GPS/UHF transmitters to study their home range size, movement and habitat use in an urban-forest mosaic in Eshowe, South Africa from March to October 2014. We estimated the home range size using three methods minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density estimation (KDE) and local convex hull (LoCoH). Our results showed that overall monthly home range size was 5.1 +/- 1.28 km(2) (mean +/- SE; 95% MCP), 4.6 +/- 1.14 km(2) (95% KDE) and 1.9 +/- 0. 46 km(2) (95% LoCoH). However, individual home range sizes varied monthly and seasonally. We found that all individuals tagged used mostly the indigenous forest and frequently utilised urban residential areas (gardens) with little or no use of cultivated land. Observed individual variations in monthly and seasonal home ranges could be a response to variations in availability of key fruit resources in the urban residential and indigenous forest mosaic. This study supports the use of more than one method of home range estimation for insight regarding home range and habitat use in urban-forest mosaics for this large forest frugivore.

AB  - Wild bird feeding often results in high densities of birds, potentially facilitating transmission of disease. Wild birds are major reservoirs of many zoonotic diseases, and although a number of avian disease outbreaks have been linked to bird feeders, urban bird-feeding and its role in disease systems remains poorly studied. We examined the impacts of typical supplementary feeding practices on the health status of feeder-visiting birds at experimental feeding stations in an urban area of New Zealand. Over an 18-month period, we screened birds captured at feeding and non-feeding properties for three pathogens and four groups of parasites to determine whether feeding altered disease dynamics. We also assessed body condition. All pathogens and parasites were detected in at least one garden bird species. Feeding stations tested positive for Salmonella enterica Typhimurium on similar to 7% of occasions, confirming that structures used in feeding are a potential transmission pathway. Feeding influenced some parasite infection parameters; these effects varied among host species. In silvereyes Zosterops lateralis, helminth prevalence and abundance were lower at feeding properties compared to non-feeding properties. In contrast, Eurasian blackbirds Turdus merula at feeding properties had a higher abundance of helminths. House sparrows Passer domesticus at feeding properties had a higher abundance of feather lice. Furthermore, our feeding regime significantly affected body condition in house sparrow and silvereye, though no associations between parasite parameters and body condition indices were found. Our results demonstrate that feeding practices can have varied effects on avian health, including no observable effects for some disease agents in some host species. Disease risks are present, however, thus understanding and reducing these risks should be a key goal for all stakeholders to protect birds that use feeders and other wildlife.

AB  - The practice of garden bird feeding is a global phenomenon, involving millions of people and vast quantities of food annually. Many people engage in the practice of feeding assuming that birds gain some benefit from the food they provide, yet recent studies have revealed the potential for detrimental impacts as well. However, there is still a paucity of information on the impacts of feeding, including the ubiquity of these impacts among and within feeder-visiting species. Consistency in feeder use among birds is likely an important determinant of this. Individual birds and species that make frequent use of feeders are more likely to experience both the benefits and detrimental impacts of supplementary food. We investigated patterns of feeder use by garden birds visiting experimental feeding stations in Auckland, New Zealand, with the specific aim of determining whether use of supplementary food was consistent or variable among individuals and species. We used camera traps as well as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to examine intra-and interspecific feeder visitation patterns and to discern species associations. Eleven bird species were detected using feeding stations, however, two introduced species (house sparrow Passer domesticus and spotted dove Streptopelia chinensis) dominated visitation events. These species were present at feeders most frequently, with the largest conspecific group sizes. Significant associations were detected among a number of species, suggesting interspecific interactions are important in determining feeder use. We also found within-species differences in feeder use for all focal species, with individual variation greatest in house sparrows. Furthermore, season had an important influence on most visitation parameters. The observed individual and species-specific differences in supplementary food resource use imply that the impacts of garden bird feeding are not universal. Crucially, particularly given the avifaunal context in New Zealand, resource dominance by introduced species could have potential negative outcomes for native species conservation in cities.

AB  - Nests are a critically important factor in determining the breeding success of many species of birds. Nevertheless, we have surprisingly little understanding of how the local environment helps determine the materials used in nest construction, how this differs among related species using similar nest sites, or if materials used directly or indirectly influence the numbers of offspring successfully reared. We also have little understanding of any potential links between nest construction and the assemblage of invertebrates which inhabit nests, in particular, ectoparasites. We addressed these questions by monitoring the success rates of Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major, using nest boxes in rural, urban greenspace and urban garden settings. We collected used nests, identified the arthropods present, and measured the proportions of highly processed anthropogenic materials used in nest construction. Twenty-five percent of Great Tit nest materials were of anthropogenic origin and this was consistent across habitats, while Blue Tits used little (1-2%) anthropogenic material except in gardens (similar to 16%), suggesting that Great Tits preferentially sought out these materials. In fledged nests, an increasing use of anthropogenic material was associated with a lower general arthropod diversity and ectoparasite predator abundance (Blue Tits only), but higher levels of Siphonaptera (fleas). Higher arthropod diversity was associated with lower flea numbers, suggesting that increased diversity played a role in limiting flea numbers. No direct link was found between breeding success and either anthropogenic material usage or arthropod diversity and abundance. However, breeding success declined with increasing urbanisation in both species and increased with nest weight in Blue Tits. The interplay between urbanisation and bird ecology is complex; our work shows that subtle anthropogenic influences may have indirect and unexpected consequences for urban birds.

TI  - "Bird cages and boiling pots for potential diseases" contested ecologies of urban 'Swiftlet farming' in George Town, Malaysia
AU  - Connolly, C
T2  - Journal of Political Ecology
AB  - This article details the social construction of the 'swiftlet farming' industry in George Town, Malaysia. It argues that narratives of health and disease continually police which landscape practices are acceptable for the increasingly globalizing and image conscious city. 'Swiftlet farming' refers to the use of inner city shophouses and other commercial buildings for harvesting the edible nests of swiftlets (constructed from their saliva). Due to the high global demand and prices for birds' nests, the number of swiftlet farms have exploded in cities and towns across the country over the past decade, as entrepreneurs have been trying to cash in on the lucrative industry. The competing discourses and reactions to swiftlet farming in George Town, particularly in relation to its alleged potential for causing outbreaks of disease such as avian flu or dengue fever offer an apt entry point for studying this contested normative landscape. In doing so, I draw on recent writing on landscape and political ecology to analyze how swiftlet farm(er) s have been politicized by various stakeholders as (in) appropriate for the urban landscape. The article concludes by considering the significance of such an approach can help to make sense of the contradictions and uncertainties that abound in urban health controversies.

AB  - Although seed dispersal is a key process determining the regeneration and spread of invasive plant populations, few studies have explicitly addressed the link between dispersal vector behavior and seedling recruitment to gain insight into the invasion process within an urban garden context. We evaluated the role of bird vectors in the dispersal of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana), a North American herb that is invasive in urban gardens in China. Fruiting P. americana attracted both generalist and specialist bird species that fed on and dispersed its seeds. The generalist species Pycnonotus sinensis and Urocissa erythrorhyncha were the most frequent dispersers. Seedling numbers of P. americana were strongly associated with the perching behavior of frugivorous birds. If newly recruited bird species use seedling-safe perching sites, the P. americana will regenerate faster, which would enhance its invasive potential. Based on our observations, we conclude that the 2 main bird vectors, P. sinensis and U. erythrorhyncha, provide potential effective dispersal agents for P. americana. Our results highlight the role of native birds in seed dispersal of invasive plants in urban gardens.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Providing food for wild birds is perhaps the most widespread intentional interaction between people and wildlife. In the UK, almost half of households feed wild birds, often as peanuts and seed supplied in hanging feeders. Such food is also taken by the introduced, invasive Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Little is known of how Grey Squirrels utilise this resource and how they affect feeder use by wild birds. To assess this we recorded the numbers and time spent by animals visiting experimental feeding stations in suburban gardens, and also asked if exclusionary guards (to prevent Grey Squirrel access), food type (peanut, mixed seed), habitat and weather conditions influenced visits. Using automated cameras, we recorded 24,825 bird and 8577 Grey Squirrel visits. On average > 44% of the time feeders were utilised, they were being visited by Grey Squirrels. Grey Squirrel presence prevented birds from feeding at the same time ( > 99.99%). Feeders where Grey Squirrels were dominant were less likely to be visited by birds, even in their absence. Guards reduced Grey Squirrel use to a minimum on seed feeders, and by approximately half on peanut feeders. Squirrels, food type, guard status, habitat and rainfall all influenced bird activity and timing of feeder visits. Our work suggests that Grey Squirrels reduce the availability of supplementary food to wild birds, while gaining large volumes of food resources with corresponding benefits. Given the ubiquity of supplementary feeding, it is likely that this is an important resource for urban Grey Squirrels; feeder guards mitigate this effect.

AB  - 1. Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes. 2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods. 3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10%-20%) at large spatial scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low (<10%) at small (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20%) at large spatial scales. 4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.

T2  - Journal of Avian Biology
AB  - Biological communities are increasingly faced with novel urban habitats and their response may depend on a combination of biological and habitat traits. The response of pollinator species to urban habitats are of particular importance because all species involved in the pollination mutualism may be affected. Nectarivorous bird communities worldwide show varying tolerances to urban areas, but studies from Africa are lacking. We investigated nectarivorous bird communities in a medium-sized South African city and asked which biological and garden traits best predict the community assembly of specialist and opportunistic nectarivorous birds. Information was collected on garden traits and the frequency of nine nectarivorous bird species for 193 gardens by means of a questionnaire. Information on biological traits of birds was obtained from published literature. Habitat generalism and tree nesting were identified as the most important biological traits influencing bird occurrence in gardens. A greater diversity of indigenous bird-pollinated plants and the presence of sugar water feeders increased the numbers of nectar specialist birds and species richness of nectarivorous birds. While bird baths increased the species richness of nectar specialist birds, opportunistic birds' urban adjustment was further facilitated by large vegetated areas in gardens and limited by the distance to the nearest natural habitat. In conclusion, though some biological traits and dispersal barriers seem to limit urban adjustment, a combination of natural and artificial nectar resource provisioning could facilitate this adjustment.

AB  - The feeding of wild birds in domestic gardens is one of the most widespread and popular forms of human-wildlife interaction throughout the Western World. The increasing recognition of the benefits to human health and well-being of contact with nature, especially in an increasingly urbanized world, reveals the need for a greater understanding of why we engage in bird feeding. This will undoubtedly result in enhanced benefits of feeding to both people and to the biodiversity it supports. Our study aimed to explore the motivations behind wild bird feeding in south-east England through both qualitative and quantitative approaches. This involved a two-phase process first, the dimensions of involvement were ascertained through semistructured interviews with 30 people engaged in feeding. Interrogation of their responses was used to construct an online questionnaire. A total of 563 respondents completed this survey. Analysis of their responses discerned a series of themes with the most salient being based on or directed toward pleasure, bird survival, nurture, education of children, and connection with nature. These findings reveal that bird feeding is underpinned by a complex array of motivations and influences involving both personal and environmental benefits.

AB  - High population growth in the tropics is driving urbanisation, removing diverse natural ecosystems. This is causing native species to suffer while introduced synanthropes flourish. City planners are developing urban greenspace networks, in part trying to address this issue. Architects contribute to these greenspace networks by designing elevated and ground level green spaces on large-scale buildings. However, little evidence is available on whether building green spaces support native fauna. This is true for birds in tropical Singapore that support important ecosystem services and have existence value. Therefore, in this study, we conducted bird surveys and statistical analyses to determine, if and how vegetation on three building green space types (ground gardens, roof gardens and green walls) have a positive impact on native or introduced bird species. We found that elevated greenery (roof gardens and green walls) on large-scale buildings supported a higher richness of birds and abundance of urban native birds than control roofs and walls without vegetation. Ground gardens supported similar levels of native species as roof gardens but also a larger proportion of generalist synanthropes. However, we found no tropical forest habitat specialists across any space type. Therefore, we recommend roof gardens and ground gardens as a potential space for urban natives outside of a less competitive ground-level urban environment. Our study also found certain building design elements (height of elevated space, presence of specific plants) supported different species groups. Therefore, we suggest that these ecological requirements for different species groups are considered when designing a building's green space.

AB  - Although bees have been demonstrated to be abundant and species-rich in cities, several studies pointed out that oligolectic species are scarce in those urban landscapes. Oligolectic species are those whose females collect pollen from a few closely related plant species or from some species belonging to the same or related plant families. We studied three nest aggregations of the oligolectic bee Centris collaris (Apidae) in an urban area. Nest aggregations were found underneath building ramps at a university campus within the city of Uberlandia, southeastern Brazil. Females were observed in nesting activity from April to May 2016. The analysis of satellite images of a 2.57-km(2) area revealed that only 0.15% was suitable for nesting sites, i.e. areas of exposed soils. Seventeen plant species were identified as floral sources of C. collaris through the pollen analysis of 43 females' scopae. The interaction analysis produced a highly specialized network (C = 0.314, H-2' = 0.744). The numbers of interactions of the plant species Senna pendula (Fabaceae), Malpighia emarginata (Malpighiaceae) and Dioclea violacea (Fabaceae) with C. collaris females were the highest, and those plants were classified as the main sources of pollen, oil, and nectar, respectively. Our results showed that in spite of the negative effects of urbanization, a small population of the oligolectic C. collaris could find places that met its biological requirements (floral resources, nesting sites) allowing for a long-term establishment in an urban area. Preservation of exposed soil areas as well as the use of native plants in urban forestry and gardening, especially those species visited by oligolectic bees, would be important measures to be adopted for bee conservation in cities.

AB  - Urban areas are often perceived to have lower biodiversity than the wider countryside, but a few small-scale studies suggest that some urban land uses can support substantial pollinator populations. We present a large-scale, well-replicated study of floral resources and pollinators in 360 sites incorporating all major land uses in four British cities. Using a systems approach, we developed Bayesian network models integrating pollinator dispersal and resource switching to estimate city-scale effects of management interventions on plant-pollinator community robustness to species loss. We show that residential gardens and allotments (community gardens) are pollinator 'hotspots' gardens due to their extensive area, and allotments due to their high pollinator diversity and leverage on city-scale plant-pollinator community robustness. Household income was positively associated with pollinator abundance in gardens, highlighting the influence of socioeconomic factors. Our results underpin urban planning recommendations to enhance pollinator conservation, using increasing city-scale community robustness as our measure of success.

AB  - Native bee populations are critical sources of pollination. Unfortunately, native bees are declining in abundance and diversity. Much of this decline comes from human landuse change. While the effects of large-scale agriculture on native bees are relatively well understood, the effects of urban development are less clear. Understanding urbanity's effect on native bees requires consideration of specific characteristics of both particular bee species and their urban landscape. We surveyed bumble-bee (Bombus spp.) abundance and diversity in gardens across multiple urban centres in southeastern Michigan. There are significant declines in Bombus abundance and diversity associated with urban development when measured on scales in-line with Bombus flight ability. These declines are entirely driven by declines in females; males showed no response to urbanization. We hypothesize that this is owing to differing foraging strategies between the sexes, and it suggests reduced Bombus colony density in more urban areas. While urbanity reduced Bombus prevalence, results in Detroit imply that 'shrinking cities' potentially offer unique urban paradigms that must be considered when studying wild bee ecology. Results show previously unidentified differences in the effects of urbanity on female and male bumble-bee populations and suggest that urban landscapes can be managed to support native bee conservation.

AB  - The high rates of urban in-migration and poverty common in many developing country towns potentially increases the reliance of urban populations on the direct benefits provided by trees. Yet understanding of the extent of such use and the sources of these tree products is limited. Here we report on the extent of use of urban tree products by 450 households in the poorer areas of three towns along a rainfall gradient based on household questionnaires. We considered the proportion of households making use of each of several tree products and the collection or purchasing frequency which we disaggregated by source of the product, including trees in homesteads, urban spaces, edges of towns and via purchase from traders. Most households (91%) used firewood, which was most frequently collected from the urban fringe or purchased, although one-third at times also collected firewood from trees on their home plot. All households used fruits, most commonly sourced through purchase (98%), but nearly half of whom also supplemented by harvesting fruits from their home plot. Other products used included wood for building, fencing and utensils, herbal medicines, planting material and mulch. Collection of products from urban homestead trees was highest amongst households in the informal settlements and least in the more established townships. Residents of new low-cost housing areas made extensive use of urban tree products harvested in urban spaces because they had fewer homestead trees than residents of informal areas or townships. Overall, urban residents made use of a wide array of tangible products from trees which they sourced from a variety of places, including their homestead plot. This urges that planning agencies ensure that homestead plot sizes or other urban spaces that provide tree products are large enough to support the direct needs of poorer urban residents.

AB  - Understanding whether and how carnivores can adapt to urbanised environments is becoming increasingly important, as human populations grow and undeveloped landscape is lost. The stone marten (Martes foina) is often found in urban habitats across continental Europe, due to its flexible foraging behaviour. We compare the utilisation of food types for martens living in villages in a more populated region with that of martens living in a less populated mountainous forest region, over the summer fruiting season (May-July) of 2013, inferred from the analysis of 310 faecal samples. Fruits were the primary food for martens in both regions, but comprised a significantly greater proportion of the diet in villages. Invertebrates and rodents were utilised significantly more in the natural habitat. Garbage and domestic animals were rarely exploited in either region; however, village-dwelling martens appeared to rely heavily on being subsidised by cultivated fruits grown in gardens and orchards, and along the streets. We conclude that the stone marten is able to succeed in urbanised regions of Central Bulgaria by exploiting cultivated food resources, attributable to its flexible and adaptable generalist diet.

AB  - Urban centers are important foci for plant biodiversity and yet widespread planting of wildflower gardens in cities to sustain pollinator biodiversity is on the rise, without full consideration of potential ecological consequences. The impact of intentional wildflower plantings on remnant native plant diversity in urban and peri-urban settings has not received attention, although shared pollinators are likely to mediate several types of biotic interactions between human-introduced plants and remnant native ones. Additionally, if wildflower species escape gardens these indirect effects may be compounded with direct ones. We review the potential positive and negative impacts of wildflower gardens on urban native flowering plants, and we reveal substantial gaps in our knowledge. We present a roadmap for research to address whether wildflower gardens, while benefiting pollinators, could also hasten the extinction of native remnant plants in urban settings, or whether they could have other effects that enrich urban biodiversity. Goals of future wildflower mixes should consider the totality of potential interactions.

AB  - Urbanization often has negative impacts on wildlife, nevertheless many species can persist in heavily modified habitats. Understanding factors that promote species persistence in urbanizing landscapes is therefore important for maintaining biodiversity in changing landscapes and may inform more biodiversity-friendly development. We investigated effects of landscape-scale variables on habitat occupancy of Smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) in the Inner Gulf of Thailand. In this internationally important wetland complex, 86% of natural habitats have been altered and are now highly urbanized. We conducted track and sign surveys in 60, 25 km(2) grid cells encompassing 1,474 km(2). Within each cell, we quantified the landscape cover types including urban areas, natural habitat (predominately thin ribbons of mangrove along waterways), agriculture, aquaculture, and potential prey availability using a GIS and field surveys. We used occupancy models to identify habitat variables that affected probability of detection and occupancy. Estimated otter occupancy, based on the top model, was 0.33 +/- 0.07 (95% CI 0.18-0.48) and detection probability was 0.50 +/- 0.05 (95% CI 0.41-0.60). Otter occupancy was positively associated with the proportion of natural habitat and the cover of traditional aquaculture ponds, but negatively associated with agriculture and urban cover. The remaining natural patches appear to act as critical refuges for otter, allowing them to persist in an otherwise heavily transformed landscape. Because aquaculture ponds are likely important prey sources for otters, it may lead to conflict with aquaculture farmers. Further studies of feeding and movement patterns in cooperation with aquaculture farmers would be beneficial for developing detailed management plans for the species in this human dominated landscape.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of urbanization on local butterfly populations and the role of butterfly gardens in preserving regional butterfly diversity. Data are from 135 butterfly gardens of varying size, location, and number of blooming plants in the Washington DC metropolitan area observed during 2001 and 2002. We investigated the species diversity for comparable gardens in rural, suburban, and urban locations to determine whether the landscape matrix surrounding otherwise suitable habitat affects the diversity found in the habitat. We hypothesized that, once factors such as garden size and number of blooming plant species were taken into account, butterfly diversity for 12 generalist species would decrease as urbanization increased. We found that there were systematic decreases (with one exception) in diversity from rural to suburban to urban gardens only for medium-sized gardens (0.10 to 0.20 ha) with one to ten types of blooming plants, and large gardens (>0.20 ha) with over 20 types of blooming plants. Gardens of other sizes or plant communities showed some decreases in diversity from rural to suburban to urban sites, but these differences were not consistent across the urban/rural gradient. Results of this study indicate that local butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human population, but that the matrix is just one factor determining generalist species diversity

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners' coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.

AB  - Urban domestic gardens (UDG) provide an interesting landscape ecology theme with conservation and biodiversity applications. Effects of habitat traits on tree species composition, spatial distribution and growth performance were studied in private UDG in Hong Kong. Five groups of tree-habitat variables were assessed species-count per garden, tree-count per garden, lot-frontage width, garden depth, and tree-position in garden. Tree structural damage and growth condition were evaluated by visual tree-assessment techniques. The results recorded 1501 trees representing 72 species distributed in 261 gardens, with heavy bias towards exotic species (81.9 %) and exotic trees (91.1 %). The top-five species contributed 45 % of relative abundance, with higher spatial-occurrence and aggregation indices. Cluster analysis classified habitats into three groups based on species similarity. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified three distinct habitats types good (cluster A), moderate (cluster B), poor (cluster C). Species distribution in CA ordination space was demarcated by structural damage and overall health condition. Nine species fell under the moderate-severe structural damage group, with four in cluster C and another four in clusters A and B. Some 41 species had poor and very poor overall condition, with seven species in cluster A and 14 in cluster C. Species groups were evaluated to inform a species selection strategy. Species adoption by homeowners is molded by habitat traits and joint operation of collective-extrinsic and individualistic-intrinsic influences which have prevented arboreal homogenization and generated spatial differentiation. Measures should address the serious biodiversity gap induced by landscape fashion, nursery-industry supply, and inappropriate species choice.

T2  - Journal of Applied Ecology
AB  - Urban expansion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, especially in tropical Africa where biodiversity hot spots are being encroached upon by fast-growing cities. Threatened species include bees and other pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126 locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces), and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management, with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees, cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they provide to both crops and native vegetation.

AB  - In recent decades, many carnivore species have colonized urban environments. Human-carnivore interactions have therefore become an important research topic for wildlife managers, conservationists, and urban planners. The aim of the present study was to examine the encounters between medium-sized carnivores and humans in the city of Turku, SW Finland, by collecting data from citizens via internet. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was the carnivore most often reported as encountered in Turku foxes were seen about 15 times more often than either raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) or badgers (Meles meles). Also, litters of all three species were observed suggesting that these carnivores have adapted enough to have breeding populations in the city. We investigated the reported encounters between medium-sized carnivores and humans in different habitats and seasons along the so-called urban-to-rural gradient. All three species were most frequently encountered in gardens. Foxes and raccoon dogs were often encountered on roads, too, whereas badgers were more often encountered in forests. The majority of reported encounters between a medium-sized carnivore and humans occurred in gardens within 5000 m from the city center in the evening and morning in summer and autumn. Foxes were also frequently encountered in open woodland (city parks). Due to the possibility of frequent contacts between wild and domestic carnivores and humans, diseases and parasites might easily spread from one species to another (both wild and domestic) in the urban environment.

AB  - Although urban agriculture is growing in popularity, little is known about the distribution of insect pollinators across urbanized landscapes. We used the pollination module of InVEST (a suite of software models used to map and value ecosystem services), along with fine-scale land cover data and empirical data on bee distributions, to assess different scenarios of urban pollinator management in Chicago, Illinois (USA). Specifically, we simulated the partial conversion of lawn/turf-grass to floral resources in city parks only, in gardens managed by individual households only, and in any available turf grass within buffer distances of 250-1000 m of urban farms, community gardens, and home gardens across Chicago. We found that the output of InVEST's pollination model was significantly related to empirical measures of bee richness (explaining 46% of the variation) but not bee abundance in Chicago. To increase pollination supply at urban farms and community gardens, our results indicate that, out of the scenarios presented here, the best strategy for the City of Chicago would be to concentrate floral resources nearby (within a 250 m buffer rather than within a 1 km buffer). In contrast, for home gardens, the model indicates that it may be better to increase floral resources throughout the city. This discrepancy may be due to the smaller size of home gardens and their more dispersed spatial arrangement throughout the city. Generally, our results indicate that converting turf grass to a more florally-rich land cover would support increased supply of pollinators and urban agriculture.

AU  - Lowenstein, D M

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63 neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815 plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106 plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified 42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than their floral abundance would predict; we call these 'highly attractive' plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by more species than unintentional 'weeds'. However, the two most-visited plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators. Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants from our list of 'highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of the highly attractive 'weeds' to persist in their gardens.

Wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus abundance in residential gardens was negatively related to the abundance of cats and the distance to the nearest patch of natural or seminatural vegetation. These results suggest that urban small mammal populations may be limited by predation and habitat fragmentation, although the effects of the latter may be offset by the availability of good quality gardens.

AB  - Cities are habitats created almost exclusively for a single species, Homo sapiens. However, the mosaic-like character of urban environments may create favourable living conditions for various populations of bees. Due to the negative impact of intensified agriculture and landscape fragmentation on pollinator insects, interest in urban areas as refuges for local bee fauna is growing. The author's three-year research has shown that the distance of a bee community from a large green space with direct connection to suburban areas is the decisive factor for bee species richness in a city. The proximity of such green space areas facilities penetration of species into cities. As for the density of bees in the urban environment, it was largely determined by host plant cover. These data are of practical importance, as they may be used in future urban green space planning.

AB  - With concerns about declines in pollinating bee species worldwide, there is renewed interest in solitary native bee species and their role in pollination services. We studied the foraging preferences and foraging distances of Lasioglossum sordidum (Halictidae), New Zealand's smallest solitary bee, in urban Christchurch. Lasioglossum sordidum were abundant within the Christchtuch Botanic Gardens. Pollen samples taken from 40 bees at each of two nest sites were identified using a pollen reference collection from the sites. Bees were collecting pollen from both native and exotic plants. In total, pollen from 23 different plant taxa was found, but 96% came from five taxa Asteraccae (65%), Hebe spp. (16%), Aesculus spp. (8%), Yucca baccata (3%) and Taraxacum officinale (3%). Individual bees usually specialised in a few pollen types, with 74% of bees having >90% of a single pollen type and a mean of 2.6 pollen types per bee. The minimum flight distances to the nearest sources of each pollen type were typically 70-250 m. These easily overlooked bees may be assisting more in general pollination services given the diversity of plant taxa from which the bees were collecting pollen, the variation from bee to bee in the plant taxa collected, and the sometimes considerable minimum foraging distances exhibited.

AB  - Urban landscapes such as college campuses, arboretums, and backyards provide excellent habitats for education and research into animal behavior. We investigated aspects of the foraging activity of free-ranging Eastern cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) on the campuses of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Lawrence University. We used giving-up densities (GUD) to test for habitat selection and patch-use behavior by cottontails inhabiting an urban landscape with a gradient of shrub and tree cover. In addition, we used small garden fences around feeding trays to test their effect as obstacles to the foraging of cottontails. Foraging activity was significantly higher under cover than in the open. GUDs were significantly lower in proximity to cover; in addition, shrubs were preferred over low-laying trees as the source of cover. Camera trap photos revealed solitary foraging, highest in the late afternoon and early morning. We demonstrated that surrounding a food patch with 3 or 4 fences increased the cottontails GUDs. Similar to natural habitats, urban landscapes offer heterogeneous environments that force their inhabitants to allocate their foraging activity according to their perceived stresses. Studying effect of habitat complexity on foraging responses provides useful tools to study ecological interactions and can help minimize the damage that cottontails cause within urban environments such as city parks and private gardens

AB  - Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to agricultural land have been shown to benefit crop production, via the provision of insect pollinators that pollinate crops. However, we do not yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are nearby, 30-50% of the garden bee community could potentially provide pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular, more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden bee movement between habitat types.

AB  - Although urban gardens provide opportunities for pollinators in an otherwise inhospitable environment, most garden plants are not native to the recipient biogeographical region and their value to local pollinators is disputed. This study tested the hypothesis that bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside their native range. Twenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was investigated using niche overlap analyses. There was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning between species based on respective preferences for native and non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum) preferred Palaearctic species. The long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias towards local biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural (weed) species may also be important for pollinator conservation.

AB  - Context. Foxes are carriers of many zoonoses, such as the fox tapeworm. Treating foxes with medication of edible bait is often the only way of protecting people. Whereas bait can be distributed very effectively by aeroplane in rural areas, in settled areas it must be distributed by hand. In doing so it is important to get as close as possible to the foxes. Aims. In suburban areas it is important to ensure that it is mainly foxes that take the bait and that they do so within a short time. In order to achieve this, a habitat model was developed for the baiting of foxes in suburban areas. Methods. In Grunwald, a suburb of Munich, 12 foxes were radio-collared and observed to see which gardens they visited more frequently or for longer periods. At the same time, the community area was divided up by a grid. At each point on the grid, two gardens were selected one garden known to be visited by foxes, and a control garden in which no fox had been observed. In this way the structure of average gardens in the community could be compared with those used by foxes. On this basis a model of garden use by foxes was developed and checked by a program of phototrapping in a separate area. Key results. Using sources of food, bushes and garden houses as variables, a habitat model was developed with the categories 'unsuitable', 'less suitable' and 'very suitable' for foxes. This correlated closely with the appearance of foxes in gardens (P < 0.001). Conclusion. The model helps to identify gardens preferred by foxes. Implications. This study shows us how to reach foxes in suburban environments quickly with bait containing medication and so contributes to improving public health. The method described, of checking a model in an area not used in the development of the model, can also be seen as a contribution towards the universalisation of models.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Trees in urban areas are important sources of ecosystem services and benefits. In most towns the bulk of urban biodiversity, and trees specifically, are found in homestead gardens. But there is only limited understanding of the tree holdings in such gardens, and how they vary within and between towns, especially for developing countries where rapid urbanisation and high poverty influence the use of and reliance on land and local resources. We report on the nature of tree holdings in private gardens of poorer suburbs in three medium-sized towns along a gradient of decreasing mean annual rainfall in northern South Africa. A total of 3 217 trees were enumerated across 450 randomly selected homesteads. Most (90 %) households had at least one tree on their homestead, with an average of 7.7 ± 6.1 trees. Most householders had planted the trees themselves. The density of trees declined along the moisture gradient. Within towns, tree density was positively related to garden size, which in turn was related to relative affluence and age of the suburb. Newer and poorer suburbs had the fewest trees per household. Sixty-two tree species were recorded, which were dominated by alien species, especially fruit trees. There was no relationship between the moisture gradient and tree species richness per household, but within towns there was a difference between suburbs, being lowest in the newest suburbs. Numbers of trees and species per household was positively related to age of the household head.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - We investigated the interacting impacts of urban landscape and gardening practices on the species richness and total abundance of communities of common butterfly communities across France, using data from a nationwide monitoring scheme. We show that urbanization has a strong negative impact on butterfly richness and abundance but that at a local scale, such impact could be mitigated by gardening practices favoring nectar offer. We found few interactions among these landscape and local scale effects, indicating that butterfly-friendly gardening practices are efficient whatever the level of surrounding urbanization. We further highlight that species being the most negatively affected by urbanization are the most sensitive to gardening practices Garden management can thus partly counterbalance the deleterious effect of urbanization for butterfly communities. This holds a strong message for park managers and private gardeners, as gardens may act as potential refuge for butterflies when the overall landscape is largely unsuitable.

TI  - Increased pollinator activity in urban gardens with more native flora
AU  - Fukase, J
AU  - Simons, Andrew M.
T2  - Applied Ecology and Environmental Research
AB  - Declining pollinator abundance has become a major global environmental concern. Almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for reproduction, and negative effects of pollinator declines on crop production have been shown. Urbanization is at least partially responsible for pollinator declines, and public programs have been developed to encourage pollinator-friendly gardens. Here, in an observational study, we investigate the relationship between pollinator activity and the proportion of native species in unmanipulated private gardens in an urban area. Pollinator activity in each of ten gardens was recorded at nine times throughout the growing season. Pollinator frequency differed among gardens, and visitation was positively associated with percent area planted with native species, after correcting for effects of time of year, plant density and total garden area. The effect of proportion native plant area on pollinator activity differed among pollinator guilds, and was particularly strong for bumble bees and large bees. The observation of heightened pollinator activity with increasing native area in this correlational study suggests that cultivating native plant species should be encouraged in urban gardens. We discuss that, although such observational studies have the advantage of realism, they cannot determine underlying causal factors driving the observed correlation.

AU  - Clark, Kyle H.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - We examine the potential role of perennial woody food-producing species ("food trees") in cities in the context of urban sustainable development and propose a multifunctional approach that combines elements of urban agriculture, urban forestry, and agroforestry into what we call "urban food forestry" (UFF). We used four approaches at different scales to gauge the potential of UFF to enhance urban sustainability and contribute to food security in the context of urbanization and climate change. First, we identified 37 current initiatives based around urban food trees, and analyzed their activities in three categories planting, mapping, and harvesting, finding that the majority (73 %) only performed one activity, and only 8 % performed all three. Second, we analyzed 30 urban forestry master plans, finding that only 13 % included human food security among their objectives, while 77 % included habitat for wildlife. Third, we used Burlington, Vermont as a case study to quantify the potential fruit yield of publicly accessible open space if planted with Malus domestica (the common apple) under nine different planting and yield scenarios. We found that 108 % of the daily recommended minimum intake of fruit for the entire city's population could be met under the most ambitious planting scenario, with substantial potential to contribute to food security even under more modest scenarios. Finally, we developed a Climate-Food-Species Matrix of potential food trees appropriate for temperate urban environments as a decision-making tool. We identified a total of 70 species, 30 of which we deemed "highly suitable" for urban food forestry based on their cold hardiness, drought tolerance, and edibility. We conclude that substantial untapped potential exists for urban food forestry to contribute to urban sustainability via increased food security and landscape multifunctionality.

TI  - Landscaping pebbles attract nesting by the native ground-nesting bee Halictus rubicundus (Hymenoptera Halictidae)
AU  - Cane, James H.
T2  - Apidologie
AB  - Most species of bees nest underground. Recent interest in pollinator-friendly gardens and landscaping focuses on planting suitable flowering species for bees, but we know little about providing for the ground-nesting needs of bees other than leaving them bare dirt surfaces. In this study, a surface layer of decorative flat stream pebbles was experimentally deployed in 24 paired subplots amid a nesting aggregation of the bee Halictus rubicundus. Over 2 years, females consistently preferred to nest amid the pebbles rather than adjacent bare dirt. Species of Halictus and their relatives (Lasioglossum, Dialictus) are widespread native floral generalists found in many urban areas of the northern hemisphere. Discovery of this practical soil nesting enhancement for H. rubicundus offers an aesthetically acceptable landscaping technique to promote these bees' nesting, particularly where pollinator gardens and bee-friendly landscaping is already being provided.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Scholarship on the ecosystem services provided by urban forests has focused on regulating and supporting services, with a growing body of research examining provisioning and cultural ecosystem services from farms and gardens in metropolitan areas. Using the case of New York, New York, USA, we propose a method to assess the supply of potential provisioning ecosystem services from species and spaces other than those explicitly designated for food production. We analyze the abundance and spatial distribution of trees and shrubs with known uses for food, medicine, craft, and other purposes across urban "greenspace" types. To do so, we created a database of all woody species known to occur in New York City, joining a citywide assessment of trees and shrubs with additional data from a metropolitan flora and a guide to native" plants in the city. A second database of useful, or forageable, species was created by compiling information from a New York City-focused online foraging application and ten field guides chosen for the likelihood that prospective foragers would find and consult them. The City's street tree inventory and associated GIS shapefile provided the basis for more detailed analyses of forageable woody species in this land use type. Our results show a substantial supply of potential provisioning ecosystem services from woody species in New York City. Coupled with growing literature on actual foraging in cities worldwide, these findings suggest implications for accountings of ecosystem services from urban forests as well as policy and management initiatives to enhance social-ecological resilience.

T2  - PeerJ
AB  - Background. Gardeners and park managers seeking to support biodiversity in urban areas often plant ornamentals attractive to flower-visiting insects. There is a huge diversity of garden plant varieties, and some recommendations are available as to which are attractive to insects. However, these are largely not based on rigorous empirical data. An important factor in consumer choice is the range of varieties available for purchase. In the UK, garden centres are a key link in the supply chain between growers and private gardens. This study is the first to determine the proportions of flowering ornamentals being sold that are attractive to flower-visiting insects. Methods. We surveyed six garden centres in Sussex, UK, each over two days in 2015, by making 12 counts of insects visiting patches of each ornamental plant on display for sale that was in bloom. To provide a consistent baseline among different locations, we brought with us and surveyed marjoram (Origanum vulgare) plants in pots, which are known to be attractive to a wide range of flower-visiting insects. The attractiveness of plant varieties to insects was then expressed in two ways the absolute number and relative to that on marjoram (marjoram score'), both per unit area of plant cover. In addition, we noted whether each variety was recommended as pollinator-friendly either via a symbol on the label, or by being included in the Royal Horticultural Society's 'Perfect for Pollinators' list. Furthermore, we compared the attractiveness of plants that are typically grown for more than one year versus only one year. Results. We surveyed 59-74 plant varieties in bloom across the six garden centres. In each garden centre, the distributions of variety attractiveness were highly skewed to the right, with most varieties being relatively unattractive, and few varieties highly attractive to flower-visiting insects. The median attractiveness of varieties with a recommendation was 4.2x higher than that of varieties without. But, due to the large variation there was a substantial number of both poor varieties that had a recommendation and good varieties that did not. Median attractiveness of multi-year plants was 1.6x that of singleyear plants, with a similar overlap in distributions. Discussion. Our study demonstrates the practicality of carrying out plant surveys in garden centres. Garden centres display large numbers of varieties for sale, most of which are in bloom. Furthermore, data gathered in garden centres appear to correlate well with data gathered in two previous studies in Sussex for plants established in gardens. Although it is unclear whether the varieties being sold in garden centres are a fair representation of varieties that are actually grown by gardeners, our results suggest that there might be considerable scope for making parks and gardens considerably more insect-friendly through judicious variety choices.

T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - It is critical to understand the specific drivers of biodiversity across multiple spatial scales, especially within rapidly urbanizing areas, given the distinct management recommendations that may result at each scale. However, drivers of biodiversity patterns and interactions between drivers are often only measured and modeled at a single scale. In this study, we assessed bee community composition at three time periods in 20 grassland and 20 agriculture sites located across two major metroplexes. We examined how local environmental variables and surrounding landscape composition impact bee abundance, richness, and evenness, including comparisons between groups with different nesting strategies and body sizes. We collected nearly 13,000 specimens and identified 172 species. We found that levels of regional land use differentially impacted bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management. Specifically, within agriculture sites, bee richness was greater with increasing landscape-level seminatural habitat, while in grassland sites, bee richness was similar across landscapes regardless of seminatural habitat cover. Bee evenness at both site types declined with increasing landscape-level habitat heterogeneity, due to an increase of rare species at the grassland sites, but not in the agricultural sites, further indicating that diversity is driven by the interaction of local habitat quality and landscape-level habitat composition. We additionally found that agriculture sites supported higher abundances, but not richness, of small-bodied and below-ground nesting bees, while grassland sites supported higher abundances of aboveground nesting bees, and higher richness of large-bodied species. Increased levels of local bare ground were significantly related to multiple metrics of bee diversity, including greater belowground nesting bee abundance and richness. Local floral richness was also significantly related to increases of overall bee abundance, as well as the abundance and richness of small bees. Overall, we suggest that local land managers can support bee abundance and diversity by conserving areas of bare soil and promoting native floral diversity, the latter especially critical in highly urban agricultural spaces. Our results provide the first documentation of significant interactions between local habitat management and landscape composition impacting insect communities in urban systems, indicating that bee conservation practices depend critically on land use interactions across multiple spatial scales.

Our research group at UC Berkeley and UC Davis conducted a 3-year survey of bee pollinators in seven cities from Northern California to Southern California. Results indicate that many types of urban residential gardens provide floral and nesting resources for the reproduction and survival of bees, especially a diversity of native bees. Habitat gardening for bees, using targeted ornamental plants, can predictably increase bee diversity and abundance, and provide clear pollination benefits.

AB  - Properly arranged ornamental gardens in both urban and agricultural landscapes can be of a benefit to bees. In this study, we observed the flowering phenology, nectar, and pollen production of the ornamental Hosta species and varieties (H. sieboldiana Engler, H. capitata Nakai, H. crispula Maekawa, H. fluctuans Maekawa, syn. H. sieboldiana var. fluctuans hort., H. undulata var. univittata Miquel (Hylander), syn. H. univittata). Our experiment was conducted in the 2012 - 2014 time period, at the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland (51 degrees 14' N, 21 degrees 34' E). The total sugar yield varied almost 5-fold among Hosta ornamentals; the lowest amount was calculated for H. fluctuans (2.31 g per 10 m(2)) and the highest for H. capitata (11.80 g per 10 m(2)). The average pollen yield was from 0.24 g per 10 m(2) (H. undulata var. univittata) to 9.53 g per 10 m(2) (H. capitata). Pollen grains were bilaterally symmetrical, and large-sized. In polar view, they were prolatum (shape index 1.33 - 1.61), while in equatorial view, oblatum (shape index 0.5 - 0.7). Hosta species can complete the summer pasture mainly for bumblebees. In four of the five Hosta representatives, bumblebees accounted for 60 - 70% of the total visits. The honeybee predominated only on the flowers of H. capitata (54 - 71%). Solitary bees were rarely observed (3 - 9% of visits). The phenotypic traits of Hosta flowers (the accumulation of nectar in the deep and narrow perianth tube) reduced the access to nectar reward and restricted an array of insect visitors.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - The neotropical frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei (Anura Eleutherodactylidae) has been referred to as a highly invasive species on grounds of its wide distribution and is expected to extend its range significantly based on recent climate model assumptions. The frog was introduced to a number of South American mainland localities, including French Guiana. Other species of the genus have become invasive on oceanic islands such as Hawaii where they pose serious biological and economical problems. No data are available on the invasion status of E. johnstonei populations from coastal South America. Here we present the first assessment of the status of a mainland population from French Guiana 10 years after the introduction of the species. We found that the species has not spread significantly within the last ten years and so far does not exhibit a high invasion potential. Frogs were restricted to urban garden habitats showing significantly higher abundance in gardens containing ornamental potted plants. Distribution patterns were best explained by two dispersal-related factors operating at different scales (1) distance of occupied sites to nearest population indicating short-distance active dispersal using stepping stone habitats, and (2) distance of occupied sites to shore with a distinct bimodal pattern indicating long-distance passive or jump-dispersal, most likely due to the exchange or transfer of ornamental plants. Even though past and current invasion potential can be considered low, we advocate the implementation of a regional monitoring scheme and detailed studies on biotic interactions with native fauna.

AB  - In urban and suburban ecosystems, biodiversity can depend on various non-native plant species, including crop plants, garden plants and weeds. Non-native plants may help to maintain biodiversity by providing a source of forage for pollinators in these ecosystems. However, the contribution of plants in urban and agricultural areas to ecosystem services has often been underestimated in biodiversity assessments. In this study, we investigated the pollen sources of native honeybees (Apis cerana) in an arboretum containing native trees and urban and agricultural plants in a suburban landscape. We surveyed the flowering tree species planted inside the arboretum, which were potential pollen sources. The number of potential pollen-source species of native trees peaked in June and July and decreased after August. We collected A. cerana pollen balls every month and identified plant species of pollen in the collected pollen balls using DNA barcoding. In total, we identified 29 plant species from A. cerana pollen balls. The probability of A. cerana using pollen from urban and agricultural plants was higher in July and August than in June. A. cerana collected pollen forages from native tree species (53%), but also gathered pollen from crop plants (13%), garden trees (19%) and native and non-native weeds (14%); the predominant pollen sources in September and October were the garden tree Ulmus parvifolia and the non-native weed Solidago altissima. We found that native honeybees used plants from a variety of habitats including non-native plants to compensate for apparent seasonal shortages of native tree sources in suburban ecosystems. Our results highlight the importance of assessments of both positive and negative roles of non-native plants in urbanized ecosystems to improve biodiversity conservation.

T2  - Acta palaeobotanica
AB  - The plants foraged by bees for honey production vary from place to place in the diverse flora of India. This paper reports a palynological study of honey from eight sites of agriculture and urbanisation in the Gangetic Plain of Uttar Pradesh (UP), and presents data from similar studies done in India. Pollen grains of 55 species were recorded in the honey from south-western, central and eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, where Ageratum conyzoides, a noxious invasive weed, is a very dominant plant taxon. The second plant community used for foraging by honeybees consists of Syzygium cumini, Feronia limonia, Eucalyptus globulus, Prosopis spicigera, Prosopis juliflora, Brassica campestris, Pimpinella tomentosa, Xanthium strumarium, and Ziziphus sp. The third plant community foraged by honeybees includes diverse plant species such as Capparis sp., Ficus sp., Murraya koenigii, Aegle marmelos, and Tinospora cordifolia, as well as Caryophyllaceae and nectarless families. The last group of plants foraged by honeybees comprises ca 37 species sparsely present in the vicinity. If honeybees have access to their preferred plant species they rarely visit non-preferred species, but in the urban and rural agricultural areas where the vegetation is sparse they are forced to forage several other plants including invasive species. The quality and character of honey, whether multifloral, monofloral, or bifloral, largely indicates the changing pattern of vegetation in a particular area, and can furnish decadal to century-scale information about the vegetational changes induced by climate or anthropopression. Palynological data also shed light on medicinally important or allergenic pollen protein present in honey (valuable information for consumers) and the details about plant taxa foraged by honeybees can be used for branding and marketing particular types of honey

AB  - We study whether butterfly diet predicts butterfly distribution along an urban gradient. Data come from a large scale participatory scheme involving the general public reporting butterfly abundance in their gardens (more than 6000 gardens), completed by a special survey on the relationship between butterfly species and flower species based on amateur pictures (more than 3500 pictures). Many studies show that urbanization promotes the loss of native plant species and their replacement by non-native species, so in this context we addressed the question of butterfly diet impacts provided by exotic and native plants in urban landscapes and we quantified diet diversity to identify specialist and generalist butterflies. Diet specialists had a longer proboscis and both specialization and proboscis length were positively correlated to preferences for exotic flowers. Nevertheless, diet specialist butterflies tended to avoid urban areas more strongly than diet generalists, while preference for exotic flowers was surprisingly not correlated to preferences for urban life in butterflies. All together this suggests that diet preferences do not play a strong part in determining butterfly distribution along urban gradients but also that diet specialization must be correlated to other life history traits such as dispersal ability or flexibility in habitat selection.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Planting food trees within local parks and other public urban green areas is starting to gain in popularity as a strategy to enhance the sustainable development of cities. However, the financial opportunity that it could represent has barely been studied. This paper investigates the financial potential of the establishment of food trees in urban public green areas of Villa El Salvador, Peru, with the help of local inhabitants. Net present value (NPV), benefit-cost Ratio (BCR), and equivalent annual cash flow (EACF) were calculated to evaluate the financial performance of two designs of productive tree systems drawn to scale for two local public parks. Results provide evidence that the involvement of a small group of local producers in the maintenance and care of public green areas could be translated, for a municipality, into financial benefits. For the producers, the possibility to harvest edible products also led to financial benefits, but only if the time invested in the productive activities was not taken into account. Thus, the use of food trees in green public areas appears to be a financially valuable alternative for both a municipality and its local inhabitants.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - A substantial proportion of the cultivated plants in urban domestic gardens in Europe are exotic species. Among these species, a large number may become invasive, causing negative impacts on natural areas. To prevent this situation, the early detection of invasive species and the assessment of propagule pressure play a key role. In this study, we analyse the flora of 258 domestic gardens in the Costa Brava to explore the importance of these factors in these urban ecosystems. Of the 635 taxa identified, 68% were exotic (77% considering only cultivated plants). Moreover, 39 species were considered invasive in Spain, although only 25 were present within the limits of the adjacent Aiguamolls de l'Emporda Natural Park (AENP). The results from multiple regression models showed that all plant biodiversity parameters (overall plant richness and exotic and native plant richness) were strongly related to the garden area, the occupancy rate of the house and the different socio-economic and cognitive characteristics of the household members. A distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) showed that the invasive species composition was related to the garden area, the age of the building, the income level and the proportion of non-working residents. We also detected that garden centres were by far the most used source of horticultural species, although garden plants were replaced and/or renewed after relatively long periods of time. We conclude that influencing homeowners' preferences by providing more detailed information in garden centres and nurseries may lead to the creation and restructuring of more native and environmentally friendly private landscapes.

T2  - Environmental Pollution
AB  - The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations.

AB  - Ecological studies on native bees in urban tropical environments are rare, however, ever-increasing urban areas world-wide necessitate study on how many of these bees can and have adjusted to human constructs. Predictable ecological patterns that emerge from these studies can provide guidance on how future urban constructs can be designed to provide habitat for conserving and protecting native bees. These patterns can also be used for bee habitat restoration in natural and agricultural environments. An extensive survey of native bees and honey bees and their relationships to a community of 102 plant types in urban residential environments of Bagaces and Liberia in northwestern Costa Rica was conducted from 2003-2012. Bees were attracted and recorded at measurable frequencies to 82 plant genera in 41 families, the most common of which was Fabaceae. Forty-two plant types were native ornamentals; 39 were non-natives; and 21 were native weed species. Standardized bee visitation (frequency) counts, 17,000+, were used to record relationships between bees and flowers. The following data were recorded for each plant type flowering phenology in months, type of floral reward(s) (pollen, nectar, and/or oil), main daily attraction period, and most frequently visiting bee taxa. Plant life forms included trees, shrubs, lianas/vines, herbs, and palms. Each plant group had a different seasonal flowering phenology with native ornamentals and native weeds having patterns that closely resembled the general patterns for wild plants in the dry forest. Predictable associations of certain bee taxa with each plant type emerged from the count data, which allowed for categorizing relationships into four types small bee, diverse bee, specialized bee, and nocturnal pollination systems. Intraspecific variations in bee attraction to several plant types were also noted. Honey bees (Africanized) did not figure prominently in most pollination relationships, especially with regard to native plants. Most native bee species were generalized foragers. Beyond the urban environment, it is suggested that knowledge of predictable bee-flower relationships can also be used to restore bee habitat in disturbed environments such as deforested areas. With some imagination and outreach education, bee habitats could also be installed for some agricultural crops. Outreaching information on native bee-flower relationships at local, regional, and state levels is important for short and long-term propagation of urban (and agricultural) plants. Yet, very few outlets for transferring this knowledge currently exist in Costa Rica. A few limited options for sharing this information are discussed, including collaborative partnerships with local NGOs.

T2  - Journal of Zoology
AB  - By studying the responses of different species to urbanization, it is possible to understand the impact of this type of habitat modification and to explore, more generally, the link between variations in the environment and changes in behaviour. We radio collared 17 badgers Meles meles from six social groups in a 1 km(2) urban study area in Brighton, UK, where local badger population density was high, and collected data on their ranging behaviour between 2005 and 2007. We aimed to determine how badgers adapt their behaviour to an urban environment and to assess the generality of previously reported differences in the ranging and territorial behaviour of urban and rural badgers. Analysis of habitat preferences and movement patterns suggested that garden habitat was principally used for foraging, while scrub and allotment habitats were important in allowing animals to travel from one part of their range to another. Group and individual home ranges were the smallest so far recorded for badgers (mean 100% minimum convex polygons=9.26 and 4.91 ha, respectively). Individual range size was negatively correlated with the availability of garden habitat, suggesting that the rich food resources provided by gardens enabled ranges to be small. Group ranges were mostly non-contiguous and there was no evidence of territorial scent marking; rather, activity was mainly restricted to areas in the vicinity of main setts. It is clear that badgers can adapt successfully to urban habitats and that this process affects various aspects of their behaviour. However, our high-density population of urban badgers displayed patterns of behaviour that differed not only from those of typical rural badgers, but also in some respects from those of a previously studied low-density urban population. We conclude that generalizations about the effects of urbanization must be made with caution.

T2  - Acta Oecologica-International Journal of Ecology
AB  - Urbanization is considered as a major driver for biotic homogenization. Urbanization also promotes the dispersal of non-native species. This study examined the roles of suburban settlements and of the surrounding landscape composition for the spread of non-native plant species into adjacent mixed deciduous forests in Southern and Northwestern Switzerland. The number and abundance of native and non-native vascular plant species in both the ground vegetation and shrub layer were recorded in 15 forest sites situated adjacent to settlements and 15 control sites far from settlements. Various site and landscape characteristics were assessed in the surroundings (100 m radius) of the study sites. In both regions we found a higher number and larger abundance of non-native plant species in forest sites adjacent to settlements than in control forest sites. Furthermore, non-native plants were more frequently recorded close to roads and in sites surrounded by a large percentage cover of garden. All these effects were more pronounced in Southern Switzerland, a region with milder winter climate, than in Northwestern Switzerland. Our study showed that settlements are a source for the spread of non-native plant species into Central European suburban forests, and that the composition of the surrounding landscape matrix (e.g. traffic infrastructure, percentage cover of gardens) also affects the establishment of non-native plants.

AB  - Ornamental flowers commonly grown in urban gardens and parks can be of value to flower-visiting insects. However, there is huge variation in the number of insects attracted among plant varieties. In this study, we quantified the insect attractiveness of 79 varieties in full bloom being grown in a public urban garden that is popular due to its beautiful flowers and other attractions. The results showed very clearly that most varieties (77%, n = 61) were either poorly attractive or completely unattractive to insect flower visitors. Several varieties (19%, n = 15) were moderately attractive, but very few (4%, n = 3) were highly attractive. Closer examination of Dahlia varieties showed that open flowered forms were approximately 20 times more attractive than closed flowered forms. These results strongly suggest that there is a great potential for making urban parks and gardens considerably more bee- and insect-friendly by selecting appropriate varieties.

T2  - Wildlife Society Bulletin
AB  - Many people look forward to spring flowers, only to discover that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) have eaten the sprouting plants and flower buds. One potential method to prevent this problem is to grow unpalatable flowering plants in gardens where deer herbivory is expected, but this requires knowledge about the relative palatability of plant species. We examined spring-flowering plants in gardens located in Cache County, Utah, USA (2010 through 2017), and recorded the proportion of leaves and flower buds browsed by mule deer. Mule deer browsing was greatest on tulips (Tulipa spp.), grape hyacinths (Muscari spp.), and crocuses (Crocus spp.) and lowest on iris (Iris spp.) and daffodils (Narcissus spp.) We hypothesized that the first plants to sprout in the spring experienced greater levels of deer herbivory because of the lack of alternate plants that deer can browse during that time of year. To test this hypothesis, we started plants in greenhouses so that they sprouted at the same time. We then placed these plants in locations throughout Cache Valley where there were deer trails and deer feces. Among these plants, tulip, liatris (Liatris spp.), and grape hyacinth were browsed heavily, suggesting that deer found these plants palatable. In contrast, crocus were rarely eaten, suggesting that deer damage on this plant results more from its early sprouting rather than its palatability. Planting unpalatable plants may be a viable approach to reducing homeowners' angst from finding that their spring-flowering plants have been browsed. Wildlife biologists and Cooperative Extension agents should find our results useful when guiding homeowners in selecting which spring-flowering plants to grow in areas where deer herbivory can be expected.

AB  - The diet of urban foxes and the availability of anthropogenic food were studied in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. A stomach analysis of 402 foxes, which were shot or found dead between January 1996 and March 1998, showed a broad variety in the diet of urban foxes, with a dominance of scavenged meat, other scavenge and cultivated fruit and crops. More than half of an average stomach content was anthropogenic. The proportion of anthropogenic food was increased in stomachs from the city centre - mainly due to the increasing proportion of scavenged meat - compared with stomachs from the periurban area. Significant seasonal variations in the diet were found for invertebrates, birds and for cultivated fruit and crops, which were all most frequently consumed in summer. A written survey among the inhabitants of three municipal districts showed that 85% of the households provided anthropogenic food which was accessible to foxes. This food supply consisted of three quarters of rubbish and compost, completed by fruit and berries and, to a Lesser extent, food provisions for pets, birds, and other wild animals. In contrast, the anthropogenic food supply of allotment gardens mainly consisted of berries, completed by fruit, compost and birdseed. The anthropogenic food supply in public areas was determined by transects. The overall food supply of households, allotment gardens and public areas would be sufficient to feed a much higher number of foxes than currently present. This overabundance of food resources could explain the continual increase of urban population densities. A possible further exploitation of anthropogenic food sources is discussed considering its specific characteristics and the necessary behavioural adaptations.

AB  - Private urban greenspaces, called 'patios' in Latin America, can act as important refuges for wildlife in scattered growing cities of the tropics. We studied the presence and abundance of the black spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura similis) in patios of Leon city (Nicaragua). Forty patios were structurally characterized and abundances of iguanas were determined through surveys of inhabitants supported by observations of specimens and burrows. Patio area and maximum tree height were variables positively related with presence and abundance of iguanas and presence of burrows. The permeability of fences for iguana movements and the presence of preferred trees for food were also related to presence and abundance of iguanas. Stepwise selection model for abundance of iguanas included number of preferred trees, maximum tree height and permeability of fences. The presence of iguanas was only explained by maximum tree height. Our results show that the indigenous-root types of patios offer the most adequate conditions for the establishment and maintenance of iguana populations among the studied cases. In the light of these results, management practices to preserve the Ctenosaura similis populations in urban patios are suggested.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of ostensibly "weedy" species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness and evenness. Our results highlight a "lazy lawnmower" approach to providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical, and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual households to contribute to urban conservation.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Fast-growing cities in tropical countries are characterized by rapid and unplanned urbanization, food crop farming and gardening in urban and peri-urban areas, and woodfuel gathering in surrounding forested areas. While urban forestry and agriculture has drawn the attention of science, decision makers, and practitioners as a valuable strategic components of the cities and of their green infrastructure, little effort has been made to understand and facilitate the introduction of high value multipurpose trees into farmlands and garden plots within or on the fringe of cities, i.e. to develop tailored agroforestry practices. To fill this gap, an ex-ante analysis of factors influencing the adoption of agroforestry systems by farmers and gardeners of urban and peri-urban areas of Kinshasa was conducted. Up to 17% of households were sampled in five communities of farmers and 3 communities of gardeners in Kinshasa for interview and farm survey. Socio-cultural factors known to influence agroforestry adoption, including household characteristics, land tenure status, farm size, current agricultural practices, labor requirement, access to external support and farmers' perception of current environmental issues were recorded. 86.4% of interviewed households were in favor of agroforestry. Provision of shade was perceived by farmers as the main function of trees on farmlands. 73.9% of respondents had planted or retained trees on their farms or gardens. Fruit production and shading were listed as top reasons for social acceptability of agroforestry. Lack of land ownership, high investment cost and long-term nature of the investment were perceived as main constraints to agroforestry adoption by 13.6% of respondents. Sequential tree-crop systems with spatial arrangement of fruit tree along farm or garden borders were identified as preferred agroforestry. The study identified farmers' education level and farm size as important factors that positively influence farmers' decision to adopt urban and peri-urban agroforestry.

AU  - Long, Alan J.

T2  - New Forests
AB  - Planted forests are often considered to consist of tree plantings at a scale large enough to satisfy such objectives as commercial production of timber and fiber, protection of watersheds, and preservation of natural habitats. However, trees are planted also at greatly reduced scales in agroforestry systems or as community woodlots to provide a mixture of products and services to resident households, local communities, and regional cultures. Agroforestry systems represent a major form of small-scale tree planting, where trees are grown in purposeful combinations with agricultural crops and/or livestock in order to take advantage of tree-crop interactions, and thereby enhance crop production, diversify farm output, stabilize or improve soils, or ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. Some important examples of these systems in tropical countries include homegardens, alley cropping, improved fallows, intercropped trees for shade and fodder production, and trees planted in hedgerows and along fence lines. Throughout the tropics, there is a large variety of indigenous practices and species mixtures that represent adaptations of these systems to meet localized needs and opportunities. Research and development programs have supported the expansion and refinement of many of these systems during the last 20 years, but substantial constraints on tree planting still exist in the form of land-tenure practices, population pressures that relegate agroforestry practices to degraded lands, subsistence needs that prevent extended periods of tree growth, and insufficient technical information or technology dissemination. Agroforestry systems in temperate, industrialized countries include combinations of trees, pasture, and livestock; fruit or nut trees interplanted with vegetable or grain crops; windbreaks and shelterbelts; multispecies riparian buffer strips; and forest farming systems for specialty crops. Compared to the tropics, however, temperate-zone systems tend to focus on one or two high-value crops, often involve some level of mechanization, and frequently represent an opportunistic approach to improving the economic profitability of farms rather than meeting subsistence needs. In both tropical and temperate regions, agroforestry systems and community woodlots will be an important component of new sustainable agriculture and environmental protection programs. Although species diversity is an essential feature of all agroforestry systems, community forests generally involve planting only a few species in small woodlots near farms, around villages, along roads, and as riparian buffers. Provincial or state governments and the local populace are often involved in landownership and plantation establishment. Major objectives of these forests are production of fuelwood for local consumption and of other tree products for market; soil stabilization, reclamation, or improvement; and protection of water quality. As with many other planted forests, the number of species widely used in community forests has been relatively small, with the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus, and Acacia providing the bulk of the species. Major issues with these "planted forests'' focus on rights for use of the products, tending responsibilities once trees are established, protection until trees are large enough for their designated use, increasing interest in using "native'' species, and greater community involvement in planning and management. Trees planted along streets and waterways, or as woodlots in parks and other public places, represent a major group of planted forests in many urban and periurban landscapes. In addition to providing many of the same environmental services that agroforests and community forests do, these urban plantings have unique aesthetic and recreational value. For much of the world's ever-increasing urban population, these may be the only tangible reference points for understanding planted forests. These relatively little-recognized forms of planted forests - planted trees, to be more appropriate - are now receiving much greater attention. There are, however, some serious technical and sociopolitico-institutional constraints to their development as more widely adopted systems in both tropical and temperate regions.

AB  - Bee species diversity is known to be high in numerous urban areas worldwide. In California our research group from the University of California at Berkeley and Davis has been conducting surveys statewide of urban bee species and their preferred host plant flowers since 2005 and find that many cities also have high species diversity. In this paper we examine in some detail the bee-flower relationships in one small residential garden in northwestern California - Ukiah in Mendocino Co. In this garden, which is densely packed with preferred bee plants, we have recorded 68 bee species; citywide, Ukiah has 91 recorded species. High bee diversity in the garden is believed to be related to the high diversity and abundance of plant materials that provide a continuous source of pollen and nectar during the entire growing season. Bee visitation counts on selective (target) plant types indicate the bee-flower relationships are relatively predictable, and this information can be used to plan and establish bee habitat gardens.

We observed White-tailed Jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii) eating spike plants (Cordyline australis), a non-native ornamental garden plant, in our front yard within the city of Edmonton, Alberta. We have noted this persistent behaviour every winter between 2006-2007 and 2011-2012. By late January, the plants were usually eaten right down to the stern base. We suggest that the White-tailed Jackrabbits turn to this food source in winter when more preferred foods are lacking, are in short supply, or are not as readily accessible. Our observations add another plant species to the list of non-native plants consumed by White-tailed Jackrabbits.

TI  - Urbanization-mediated context dependence in the effect of floral neighborhood on pollinator visitation
AU  - Fitch, Gordon M.
T2  - Oecologia
AB  - Context dependence in ecological interactions is widespread, but our ability to predict how environmental variation will mediate the effects of a given interaction remains poor. Co-flowering plants can influence visitation of shared pollinators to one another; the effect of these interactions varies with ecological context. While research has investigated the effect of local biotic conditions on such interactions, little is known about how land use change, specifically urbanization, affects them. I tested how the interaction of urbanization and neighborhood floral density (NFD) and richness affected pollinator visitation rates to two crop species, cucumber and sunflower by placing experimental arrays of each species in paired high- (garden) and low- (lawn) floral density neighborhoods along an urban-to-rural gradient. Pollinator visitation to flowers was monitored over 2 years, as was NFD and richness. The two plant species showed contrasting responses to both urbanization and floral neighborhood density, with only cucumber experiencing context dependence in the effect of floral neighborhood. These contrasting responses to urbanization and floral neighborhood are likely due to differences between species in floral visitor community composition. Plants grown in gardens experienced higher pollinator visitation regardless of floral neighborhood. This study highlights the need for better understanding of genus- or species-specific pollinator responses to urbanization to predict the effect of urbanization on plant-pollinator interactions.

AB  - Wildlife-friendly gardening practices can help conserve biodiversity in urban areas. These include growing ornamental plant varieties attractive to flower-visiting insects. Because varieties vary greatly in attractiveness, there is a need to quantify it in order to give objective advice to gardeners. Here, we used the British national collection of asters to compare the attractiveness of varieties to flower-visiting insects. We counted and identified insects as they foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We also scored attributes relevant to gardening attractiveness to humans, ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects, ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed, with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and 64% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects. These results imply that choosing varieties carefully is likely to be of conservation benefit to flower-visiting insects, and that doing so is a no-cost option in terms of garden beauty and workload.

AB  - Apocephalus borealis phorid flies, a parasitoid of bumble bees and yellow jacket wasps in North America, was recently reported as a novel parasitoid of the honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera Apidae). Little is known about the ecology of this interaction, including phorid fecundity on bee hosts, whether phorid-bee parasitism is density dependent, and which local habitat and landscape features may correlate with changes in parasitism rates for either bumble or honey bees. We examined the impact of local and landscape drivers and host abundance on phorid parasitism of A. mellifera and the bumble bee Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera Apidae). We worked in 19 urban gardens along the North-Central Coast of California, where phorid parasitism of honey bees was first reported in 2012. We collected and incubated bees for phorid emergence, and surveyed local vegetation, ground cover, and floral characteristics as well as land cover types surrounding gardens. We found that phorid parasitism was higher on bumble bees than on honey bees, and phorids produced nearly twice as many pupae on individual bumble bee hosts than on honey bee hosts. Parasitism of both bumble and honey bees increased with abundance of honey bees in a site. Differences in landscape surroundings did not correlate with parasitism, but local factors related to bee resource provisioning (e.g., tree and shrub abundance) positively correlated with increased parasitism. This research thus helps to document and describe conditions that may have facilitated phorid fly host shift to honey bees and further elucidate how resource provisioning in urban gardens influences bee-parasite interactions.

AB  - Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under threat. Urban areas could be important for pollinators, though their value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We compared pollinator communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites (each 1 km(2)) in three landscapes urban, farmland and nature reserves. Overall, flower-visitor abundance and species richness did not differ significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did not differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban areas than farmland. Hoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness did not differ significantly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous across space than those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no significant difference in the numbers of rarer species between the three landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than urban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a greater number of plant species (higher generality) but also visited a lower proportion of available plant species (higher specialization), both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are growing, and improving their value for pollinators should be part of any national strategy to conserve and restore pollinators.

AB  - The variability of bee communities along an urban gradient has a potentially strong impact on pollinator-plant interactions. We investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition in the city centre and suburbs of PoznaA", Poland. During 2006-2008 we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant species was . Other abundant species were , , , . Several species appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities.

AU  - Burkman, Caitlin E.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Many Midwestern cities in the United States have experienced high levels of economic decline and population loss. This deindustrialization has led to thousands of acres of vacant land maintained as grassy habitats. The communities living within these neighborhoods have conceptualized reutilization strategies for this land, including urban agriculture and the creation of small parks of native plantings. In this 2-year study, we examined the impacts of vacant land conversion on spiders within residential vacant lots, community gardens, and planted prairies within the peri-urban park system. At the time of the study, planted prairies on previously vacant land were not common, so those within the park system may serve as a foundation for future plantings. We found that maintained vacant lots contained the most numerous spider assemblages, which was dominated by disturbance-tolerant habitat generalist species. Community gardens contained numerically fewer spiders but a slightly richer assemblage than vacant lots. Similarly low numbers were also found in planted prairies but the assemblage was the most diverse of the greenspaces examined. We also contrasted results at the family versus genus level in order to assess the taxonomic sufficiency relevant for future studies, and found that genus level was important for elucidating the effects of urban land use on these spider assemblages. From this research, we conclude that spiders are an important indicator group of disturbance when examining urban greenspace management and revitalization, and that alteration in greenspace design will influence biodiversity and assemblage composition.

AB  - Broad-scale modification of natural ecosystems associated with urbanisation often leads to localised extinctions and reduced species richness. Despite this, habitats within the urban matrix are still capable of supporting biodiversity to varying degrees. As species have different responses to anthropogenic habitat modification, the species composition of urban areas can depend greatly on the habitat characteristics of the local and surrounding areas. The aim of this study was to compare the community composition of spiders in private gardens, urban parks, patches of remnant vegetation and continuous bushland sites, so as to identify habitat variables associated with variation in spider populations along and within the urban gradient and matrix. Overall spider abundances and richness were highest in remnant vegetation patches and were associated with increased vegetation cover at microhabitat and landscape-scales. While gardens were not as diverse as remnant patches, they did support a surprisingly high diversity of spiders. We also found that species composition differed significantly between gardens and other urban green spaces. Higher richness within gardens was also associated with greater vegetation cover, indicating the importance of private management decisions on local biodiversity. Differences in community composition between land-use types were driven by a small number of urban-tolerant species, and spider guilds showed different responses to habitat traits such as vegetation cover and human population densities. This study demonstrates that urban land-uses support unique spider communities and that maintaining vegetation cover within the urban matrix is essential in order to support diverse spider communities in cities.

TI  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp) along a gradient of increasing urbanization.
AU  - Ahrne, Karin
AU  - Bengtsson, Jan

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Bumble bees and other wild bees are important pollinators of wild flowers and several cultivated crop plants, and have declined in diversity and abundance during the last decades. The main cause of the decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification. Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied bumble bees in allotment gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals) decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee species. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that allotment gardens and other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in areas strongly influenced by human activity.

AB  - Bumblebees are well known for their contribution to the ecosystem service of pollination. In urban areas, green space management beneficial to pollinators can be an important step in sustaining large urban bee populations. The abundance, number of species and diversity of bumblebees (Bombus spp), as well as the abundance of honeybees (Apis mellifera), were studied in 13 urban gardens (including allotments) and 13 ornamental flowerbeds (in parks and green spaces) in the city centre of Gothenburg, Sweden. In total, 12 species of bumblebees were observed. Species richness was significantly higher in gardens than in flowerbeds, but diversity (Berger-Parker and Simpson indices) was higher in flowerbeds than in urban gardens. The abundance in gardens was significantly higher and approximately twice that found in flowerbeds. The number of honeybee individuals was positively correlated with the abundance of bumblebees. Neither species richness nor abundance of bumblebees was affected by site size. However, a high flowering frequency positively affected the total number of bumblebee and honeybee individuals at the sites. We conclude that urban gardens contribute to sustaining a high abundance of bumblebees in the city centre, and indirectly facilitates small scale urban food production. A pollinator-friendly management of urban green space with plentiful flowering may promote a community of bumblebees with high abundance and diversity.

AB  - Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators. However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral resources. We used a 'mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30 residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination. Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and potentially positive effect on crop pollination.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urbanization is increasing worldwide. Urban habitats often support considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local (mean monthly distances 0.5-1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding urban area (monthly means 78-92 %) versus the countryside (closest distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary, however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom.

AB  - A survey of the bee species and their ornamental host flowers that occur in residential neighborhoods of the cities of Albany and adjacent Berkeley in northern California was conducted from 1999-2003. A simple bee frequency (visitation) count was developed to evaluate the relative attraction of bees to their host flowers. Results of the survey revealed that 76 species of bees, mostly natives, from five families, visited 129 host plants at measurable levels. The most common host plant families were Asteraceae, Lamiaceae, Polygonaceae, Rosaceae, and Scrophulariaceae. Honey bees and all other bee taxa were recorded separately on host plants, and both bee groups were more attracted to California native plants than exotics on a percentage basis. Variable attraction was recorded within native and exotic host plants, and a large pan of this variation appears related to where the plants are found in residential areas. In general, the highest bee diversity and abundance was observed in diverse gardens having a high number of bee-attractive plants flowering at the same time. Ground nesting by several species was also noted in diverse and other garden sites. Overall, many bee species seem pre-adapted to use extant urban resources for forage, reproduction and survival in residential areas of these two California cities.

AB  - As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees (Hymenoptera Apoidea Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages. We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675 individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95% were native, 50% were solitary, and 93% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of specimens, eusocial (50% of specimens), native (97%), and polylectic (98%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and 19% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species (6% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host relatively diverse and intact bee communities.

AB  - Increasing human land use for agriculture and housing leads to the loss of natural habitat and to widespread declines in wild bees. Bee foraging dynamics and fitness depend on the availability of resources in the surrounding landscape, but how precisely landscape related resource differences affect bee foraging patterns remains unclear. To investigate how landscape and its interaction with season and weather drive foraging and resource intake in social bees, we experimentally compared foraging activity, the allocation of foragers to different resources (pollen, nectar, and resin) and overall resource intake in the Australian stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria (Apidae, Meliponini). Bee colonies were monitored in different seasons over two years. We compared foraging patterns and resource intake between the bees' natural habitat (forests) and two landscapes differently altered by humans (suburban gardens and agricultural macadamia plantations). We found foraging activity as well as pollen and nectar forager numbers to be highest in suburban gardens, intermediate in forests and low in plantations. Foraging patterns further differed between seasons, but seasonal variations strongly differed between landscapes. Sugar and pollen intake was low in plantations, but contrary with our predictions, it was even higher in gardens than in forests. In contrast, resin intake was similar across landscapes. Consequently, differences in resource availability between natural and altered landscapes strongly affect foraging patterns and thus resource intake in social bees. While agricultural monocultures largely reduce foraging success, suburban gardens can increase resource intake well above rates found in natural habitats of bees, indicating that human activities can both decrease and increase the availability of resources in a landscape and thus reduce or enhance bee fitness.

The first one (1985-86) involved the sampling of Biomphalaria tenegophila in two areas to determine its relative populational densities. The results showed that the populations presented similar densities and dynamics. The second phase (1988-89) involved the study of the influence of some environmental factors on the establishment of B. tenagophila in watercress garden. Two factors were identified as responsible for the establishment of B. tenagophila in the garden (1) the quality of the water entering the irrigation system, to which domestic sewage is added, and (2) alterations in the nature of the substrate, due to inadequate fertilization techniques, which employ organic matter from adjacent pigsties. Aquatic plants and hydrological parameters of the irrigation system were subsidiary factors to the establishment of B. tenagophila in the garden.

TI  - Sampling arthropod diversity for urban ecological landscaping in a species-rich southern hemisphere botanic garden

T2  - Journal of Insect Conservation
AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

AB  - Population studies of invasive species allow us to understand how invaders react to new biotic and abiotic conditions, and how native species react to invasion. We evaluated the colonisation efficiency of the invader Zaprionus indianus (Gupta), in the urban area of Porto Alegre city, southern of Brazil. Samples of flies were taken from three urban parks, and ecological indexes were used based on the frequency of the sampled species. The indexes were calculated for breeding and feeding sites separately. The highest frequencies of Z. indianus compared to the other drosophilids were registered during seasons of highest mean temperatures, both for the feeding and the breeding sites. The highest values for the dominance index (D) and the lowest values for diversity (IT) were found at the same seasons and for both components. An analysis of the values for Morisita similarity index shows that the Botanical Garden and Farroupitha Park had higher similarity in terms of diversity of the breeding sites. For the feeding sites the highest similarity was between Farroupilha Park and Gabriel Knijnik Park. Despite the three parks have some particularities, the ease with which Z indianus became established at these places seem to be the same. The arrival of this invader seems to be promoting adjustments in the survival strategies of the resident species, at least at certain periods when the frequency of the populations of the invader increases significantly. However, most of species seem to be able to coexist with the invader.

T2  - Biological Control
AB  - We conducted field experiments to test the hypothesis that regulation of herbivorous pests in urban landscapes can be enhanced with forbs that provide floral resources for adult natural enemies. The herbivore was bagworm, Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis (Haworth) (Lepidoptera Psychidae), which is attacked by a guild of hymenopterous parasitoids. We established host shrubs in common garden plantings, encircling some with flowering forbs, released bagworm larvae on shrubs, and assessed survivorship. The hypothesis was supported parasitism rates of bagworm were 71% higher in shrubs that were surrounded by flowering forbs than in shrubs that lacked flowers. This study also suggested that white-footed mice and European sparrows were important predators of bagworms. The most abundant parasitoid species was the exotic ichneumonid Pimpla (= Coccygominus) disparis (Vierick), an introduced biological control agent of gypsy moth. In a second experiment, parasitism rates were at least three times higher in shrubs encircled by a high density of forbs compared to those having fewer or no forbs. In a third experiment, parasitism rates exceeded 70% in shrubs that were adjacent to a central bed of flowering forbs, but less than 40% in shrubs that were farther away. We conclude from these studies that flowering forbs have a localized effect on host-searching behavior of female parasitoids, encouraging them to parasitize bagworms in the immediate vicinity. This study provides further evidence that ecological methods of pest management can be integrated into the design of urban landscapes to improve regulation of herbivorous pests.

AB  - The goal of this study was to document the distribution and establishment A. fulica such as their feeding preference and behavior in situ. The study was carried out at the city of Lauro de Freitas, Bahia state, Brazil, between November 2001 and November 2002. We used catch per unit effort methods to determine abundance, distribution, habitat choice and food preference. The abundance and distribution of A. fulica was most representative in urban area, mainly near to the coastline. Lots and house gardens were the most preferred sites during active hours. The results indicated that A. fulica started their activity at the end of the evening and;topped in mid-morning. Their preferred food were vascular plants such as Hibiscus syriacus, Ricinus communis, Carica papaya, Galinsonga coccinea, Lippia alba, Ixora coccinea, Musa parasidisiaca, Mentha spicata and Cymbopogon citrates. Our results indicate that A. fulica are well adapted and established in this city and modified environments facilitate their establishment and dispersion. However. human perturbation, such as clearance of lots could be limiting for the persistence of A. fulica populations.

AB  - To investigate the impact of urban agriculture on malaria transmission risk in urban Accra larval
and adult stage mosquito surveys, were performed. Local transmission was implicated as Anopheles spp. were found breeding and infected Anopheles mosquitoes were found resting in houses in the study sites. The predominant Anopheles species was Anopheles gambiae s.s.. The relative proportion of molecular forms within a subset of specimens was 86% S-form and 14% M-form. Anopheles spp. and Culex quinquefasciatus outdoor biting rates were respectively three and four times higher in areas around agricultural sites (UA) than in areas far from agriculture (U). The annual Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR), the number of infectious bites received per individual per year, was 19.2 and 6.6 in UA and U sites, respectively. Breeding sites were highly transitory in nature, which poses a challenge for larval control in this setting. The data also suggest that the epidemiological importance of urban agricultural areas may be the provision of resting sites for adults rather than an increased number of larval habitats. Host-seeking activity peaked between 2–3 am, indicating that insecticide-treated bednets should be an effective control method.

AB  - A cross-sectional survey of agricultural areas, combined with routinely monitored mosquito larval information, was conducted in urban Dar es Salam, Tanzania, to investigate how agricultural and geographical features may influence the presence of Anopheles larvae. Data were integrated into a geographical information systems framework, and predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in farming areas Were assessed using multivariate logistic regression with independent random effects. It was found that More than 5%, of the Study area (total size 16.8 km(2)) Was used (Or farming in backyard gardens and larger open spaces. The of habitats containing Anopheles larvae was 1.7 times higher in agricultural areas compared to other areas (95% confidence interval = 1.56-1.92). Significant geographic predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in gardens included location in lowland areas, proximity to river, and relatively impermeable soils. Agriculture-related predictors comprised specific seedbed types, mid-sized gardens, irrigation by wells, as well as cultivation Of sugar cane or leafy vegetables. Negative predictors included small garden size, irrigation by tap water, rainfed production and cultivation Of leguminous Crops Or fruit trees. Although there was an increased chance of finding Anopheles larvae ill agricultural Sites, it was found that breeding sites originated by urban agriculture account for less than a fifth of all breeding sites of malaria vectors in Dar es Salam. It is suggested that strategies comprising all integrated malaria control effort ill malaria-endemic African cities include participatory involvement of farmers by planting shade trees near larval habitats.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban green spaces provide important ecosystem services, such as amenity, biodiversity, productivity, climate amelioration, hydrological and biogeochemical cycling. Intensively managed urban gardens can sequester carbon through vegetation growth and soil C increase, but may experience nitrous oxide (NO) emissions and reduced soil methane (CH) uptake from irrigation and fertiliser use. Soil atmosphere exchange of NO, CH and carbon dioxide (CO) was measured in lawn and wood chip mulched garden areas in Melbourne, Australia in winter, spring and summer under various water and fertiliser regimes. Gas exchange before and after lawn fertiliser application was measured continuously for three weeks using an automated chamber system. Applying fertiliser led to a peak NO emission of >60 g N m h, but overall only weekly irrigation (10 mm) significantly increased mean soil NO emissions above that in other treatments. Under mulch, mean soil NO emissions (14.0 g N m h) were significantly smaller than from irrigated lawn (27.9 g N m h), whereas mean soil CH uptake under mulch (30.7 g C m h) was significantly greater (p<0.01) than in any lawn treatment. Lawns were either a weak CH sink or source. Soil C density (0-25 cm) under mulch (12.5 kg C m) was greater that under lawn (8.0 kg C m). On a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO-e) basis, soil NO emissions offset the benefits of soil CH uptake. Mulched garden areas provide greatest C sequestration potential in soil and vegetation and the smallest non-CO emissions, as soil CH uptake offsets a large fraction of soil NO emissions. Results of this study suggest that reducing the irrigation and fertiliser application to lawns can help mitigate GHG emissions from urban garden systems, and increasing the area of mulched perennial garden beds can also provide net GHG benefits; however, this needs to be tested in other garden systems with different soil types and environmental conditions

AU  - Butler, Colleen

T2  - Ecological Engineering
AB  - Green roofs have the potential to function as islands of biodiversity within urban and suburban environments. However, plant diversity is constrained by the harsh environment of a green roof, especially summertime water deficit and heat stress. We hypothesized that Sedum species, which are highly tolerant of the roof-top environment, would reduce peak soil temperature and increase performance of neighboring plants during summer water deficit. To test these hypotheses, we grew focal plant species with and without Sedum on a green roof. We then monitored growth during wet periods and drought tolerance during dry periods. During a three-year experiment. S. album reduced maximum growth of neighbor plants. Agastache rupestris and Asclepias verticillata, during favorable growth conditions, but increased performance of neighbors during summer water deficit. In a second experiment, four species of Sedum were each found to decrease peak soil temperature by 5-7 degrees C. All species decreased total growth of neighboring Agastache 'Black Adder' during favorable growth conditions, but again increased performance during summer water deficit. These results suggest that the palette of green roof plants can be expanded by using Sedum species as nurse plants.

AU  - Bennett, Ashley B.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Urbanization is a major driver of land cover change worldwide, yet little is known about how urbanization affects beneficial arthropod communities. This study examined how local and landscape scale variables associated with urbanization influenced parasitic Hymenoptera abundance and diversity in residential and commercial properties along a rural to urban landscape gradient in Wisconsin. At a landscape scale, 300 m surrounding sites, land cover percentages were calculated for five cover classes impervious cover, forest, grassland, agriculture, and urban green space. In addition, habitat diversity (Simpson's index) was calculated for the landscape surrounding study sites. At a local scale (within the boundaries of an individual property), flower diversity, flower area, tree density, and hardscape were measured and related to parasitoid abundance and diversity. During 2006 and 2007, parasitoids were sampled twice a month June-August using yellow sticky cards. Parasitoid abundance was a positive function of flower diversity, a local scale variable. The positive relationship between parasitoid abundance and flower diversity only occurred in areas containing high to moderate levels of urban development, suggesting parasitoids locally benefited from the increased availability of floral resources in urban but not rural sites. Parasitoid diversity decreased as impervious cover increased in the surrounding landscape. Parasitoid diversity decreased by approximately 10% in highly urbanized sites relative to rural sites, a pattern driven by several parasitoid families not detected in urban sites. These results suggest conservation strategies that focus on landscape variables at multiple scales can play an integral role in preserving beneficial arthropods across urban landscapes.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Carefully designed green roofs have the potential to be used as mitigation for habitats lost at ground level. The development of plant assemblages on two green roofs designed to emulate diverse brownfield habitats (brown roofs), by using recycled demolition aggregate as part of a low-fertility growth substrate, were studied over the first four years of their development. The cover-abundance of flowering plants and habitat structural components (e.g. bare ground, moss) were measured on the Domin-Krajina scale within all identified microhabitats. Drought disturbance was one of the main controlling factors on assemblage development. Annual plants were abundant and successful in the first growth season, and thereafter only re-appeared in any numbers following drought disturbances in subsequent years. Moss and Sedum acre L increased through the study period until these plants dominated coverage. The cover-abundance of perennial wildflower species was strongly influenced by drought disturbance. The influence of drought disturbance varied between different brown roof microhabitats, with plant assemblages in coarser and less fertile microhabitats more resistant to these disturbances. Observed responses to drought were consistent with the following two hypotheses (i) Areas of coarse substrate can act as disturbance refugia for plants during drought by helping preserve pockets of water under large clasts and within absorbent materials such as brick. (ii) The plant assemblages living in areas of more fertile substrates, which grow more luxuriantly when water availability is high, are more vulnerable to drought disturbance. Green roofs should be designed to include a range of substrate types to create several microhabitats that will collectively support more species than any single microhabitat.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Two synchronous projects undertaken in 2011 examined the likely impact of increasing urban densification on invertebrate populations within urban settlement in Perth, Western Australia. One project analysed the ant fauna found in 20 gardens and lawns in small to very small properties (these having a bungalow or duplex (semi-detached) as the main residential building, and a lawn or garden area of 43 m(2)-332 m(2)) east, south, north and west of the Central Business District (CBD). The other project examined the ant fauna at 14 sites, principally in native regrowth along the Kwinana Freeway, a major artery that runs north to south through Perth's suburbs. The gardens and lawns produced a very depauperate fauna of 26 ant species, of which a maximum of 20 were native and at least six species were exotic. The ant fauna from regrowth adjacent to the Kwinana Freeway and at two additional sites (one a bush control) was more than twice as rich, the 56 species collected including only two exotics. In the garden project, ant richness, evenness and abundance were not significantly correlated with size of the garden area. The same applied even when the exotic Pheidole megacephala-dominated gardens were removed from the analysis. Ordination analysis combining the two sets of data revealed a distinct clustering of most of the regrowth sites, whereas the bush control stood alone and garden or lawn sites exhibited a much looser pattern of association. We suggest that increasing the density of Perth suburbs is resulting in drastic loss of native invertebrate fauna, of which ants are a useful bioindicator. However, native vegetation regrowth along major arterial roads could act as a reservoir for invertebrate species that might otherwise disappear entirely from the Perth metropolitan area.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Land vacancy is a persistent phenomenon in urban landscapes in the United States, yet little is known about the ways vacant lots are used in practice and the functions they serve in local communities. Here, we offer insight into the composition, uses and neighborhood context of vacant lots in New York City. Using ArcGIS and Google Earth, we conducted a visual survey of 5% of vacant lots in each New York City borough, collecting land cover and actual use data. Results indicate that many vacant lots in New York City are used as community gardens, residential yards, parks, parking areas and sports fields. Neighborhood income and lot vegetation are significantly associated with most of the ways that vacant lots are used in practice. In particular, lots which are actually unused (33%) tend to be located in neighborhoods with relatively high population density and low median household income levels. We suggest that by assessing vacant lot uses, ecological characteristics and the social characteristics of neighborhoods in which vacant lots are located, planners may be able to more effectively address urban land vacancy while supporting urban sustainability and resilience.

AB  - Due to economic decline and the recent rise in home foreclosure, many U.S. cities are faced with managing large acreages of vacant land. Interest in local food production on this land has the potential to dramatically reshape the composition of greenspace found within urban landscapes. This study examined how the conversion of vacant land to urban gardens and farms influenced arthropod generalist predator populations and their ability to support biocontrol services. We found that the abundance of Coccinellidae and Syrphidae, and the activity density of Carabidae, Formicidae, and Lycosidae were equivalent among vacant lot and urban garden sites. Dolichopodidae abundance and the activity density of Linyphiidae and Opiliones were reduced in urban gardens whereas Anthocoridae abundance and the activity density of Staphylinidae were greater within urban gardens relative to vacant lots. The biocontrol service supplied by generalist predators was measured using sentinel eggs (Helicoverpa zea (Noctuiidae)) and pupae (Sarcophaga bullata (Sarcophagidae) and Musca domestica (Muscidae)). We found no difference in the biocontrol of H. zea eggs or M. domestica pupae among the focal greenspaces. We found no difference in the removal of S. bullata pupae by predators in June 2010, whereas in August 2010 a greater proportion of pupae were removed in urban garden sites relative to vacant lots. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential of the urban landscape to support generalist predators and sustainable urban gardening and farming.

TI  - Perceptions and contributions of households towards sustainable urban green infrastructure in Malaysia
AU  - Barau, Aliyu S.
T2  - Habitat International
AB  - Household perception of urban greenery is a vehicle for understanding socio-ecological dimensions of grassroots urban sustainability. It also helps in advancing public participation in urban green infrastructure initiatives. The present study measures public perception of urban households using questionnaire survey and observations of how people maintain plants in and around their homes and neighbourhoods in parts of Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The selection of the participating households reflects on Malaysia's racial composition of which about 60% is Malay, 30% Chinese, and 10% Indians respectively. The study compares gender, age, and job status of the respondents against 14 variables to determine perceptions on socio-ecological aspects of plant keeping practices. The Rasch model's Wright map and differential item functioning (DIF) were used to analyse the respondents' perceptions. The findings revealed that on average, households with the least number of plants keep 1-9 species, while those with the highest number keep over 30 plant species. In respect of ecosystem services, the three racial groups maintain plants for aesthetics, culinary, socio-cultural and spiritual purposes. Finally, the study underscores the need for urban planning authorities and urban landscape managers to encourage and engage households as part of strategies for streamlining and mainstreaming urban resilience and transformation to urban sustainability.

AB  - 1. Invertebrate biodiversity was investigated in 55 domestic gardens in the city of Dunedin in southern New Zealand. The influence of habitat types within the gardens (lawns, open beds, and closed canopy beds) on invertebrate community structure was investigated by pitfall trapping. Species richness of Coleoptera, the proportion of native species, and effects of pesticide use by householders was examined. 2. The most abundantly trapped taxa were Collembola, Amphipoda, and Diptera. Most taxa were represented in all three habitat types, but Collembola, Diptera, and Araneae were most frequently collected in lawns and Isopoda in open beds. 3. The use of pesticides had no effect on total trap catch, but detritivore numbers were higher in gardens where no insecticide had been used. Opiliones and Acarina were captured in greater numbers in gardens where herbicides had not been used. 4. Over 1400 Coleoptera were identified to 164 species/morphospecies. Species richness averaged 12 species per garden. Staphylinidae, Curculionidae, and Carabidae were the most abundantly collected Coleoptera, both for species and individuals. Species richness was not affected by vegetation type. The coleopteran fauna was predominantly native (80-90%) for species and individuals. 5. The capture of a new to New Zealand weevil species (Exomias pellicidus (Boheman)) suggests that urban studies could play a role in alerting authorities to biosecurity incursions. The study stimulated considerable interest in invertebrates from householders, which might help fill the gap between acquiring environmental awareness and encouraging changes in behaviour towards support for native biodiversity.

AB  - Green roofs can alleviate the environmental impacts of reduced green areas resulting from rigorous urban developments. In Taiwan's hot and crowded urban environment, green roofs are indicative of green buildings. Rooftop plants must be able to withstand harsh natural environmental conditions. Coastal vegetation has a high level of tolerance. Therefore, this study selected the seashore coastal region seashore vegetation with landscape scenic features as well as drought, wind, and temperature resistance characteristics as materials for a green roof. Based on the records and analysis of vegetation characteristics provided by the Flora and Vegetation of Taiwan, this study selected coastal hilly plants, as well as coastal beach herbaceous plants, such as plant species for green roofs in Taiwan. A 10 m x 20 m reinforced concrete flat roof structure was selected and designed as the demonstration site to present the coastal vegetation rooftop garden.

AB  - Germination characteristics of 10 xerophytic species, widespread in the Mediterranean were studied. A variety of seed treatments were explored to overcome the seed dormancy, including scarification and stratification. Only in Convolvulus cantabrica dormancy was shown to be physical, since it could be removed by seed coat scarification. Several species showed light -dependent germination, possibly related to the fact that in their micro-environment of incubation they are exposed to minimum seed burial. Emergence tests in peat-perlite substrate were carried out in order to verify the optimal burial conditions for seed propagation. This inhibition was found to be inversely related to the low unit weight of seed. Species with minute seeds, such as Erigeron karviskianus and Phagnalon rupestris, had the best performance of germination without burial, while the larger ones such as Ccantabrica and Centranthus ruber, had the best performance at 6 and 4 mm of sowing, respectively.

AU  - Burks, Julia M.

T2  - Environmental Entomology
AB  - Urbanization negatively affects biodiversity, yet some urban habitat features can support diversity. Parasitoid wasps, an abundant and highly diverse group of arthropods, can inhabit urban areas and do well in areas with higher host abundance, floral resources, or local or landscape complexity. Parasitoids provide biological control services in many agricultural habitats, yet few studies have examined diversity and abundance of parasitoids in urban agroecosystems to understand how to promote conservation and function. We examined the local habitat and landscape drivers of parasitoid abundance, superfamily and family richness, and parasitoid composition in urban gardens in the California central coast. Local factors included garden size, ground cover type, herbaceous plant species, and number of trees and shrubs. Landscape characteristics included land cover and landscape diversity around gardens. We found that garden size, mulch cover, and urban cover within 500 m of gardens predicted increases in parasitoid abundance within gardens. The height of herbaceous vegetation and tree and shrub richness predicted increases in superfamily and family richness whereas increases in urban cover resulted in declines in parasitoid richness. Abundance of individual superfamilies and families responded to a wide array of local and landscape factors, sometimes in opposite ways. Composition of parasitoid communities responded to changes in garden size, herbaceous plant cover, and number of flowers. Thus, both local scale management and landscape planning may impact the abundance, diversity, and community composition of parasitoids in urban gardens, and may result in differences in the effectiveness of parasitoids in biological control.

AB  - Pests of urban vegetation cause substantial aesthetic, economic and biodiversity damages, by weakening or completely destroying the plants. The recent climate changes, such as the excessive droughts alternating with heavy rain falls, and the significant imports of ornamental plants for urban landscape, as small parks, private gardens, and vertical walls, drastically increase the number of urban pests. These species are either newly introduced in the area, either they enlarge their host plant spectrum or increase their aggressiveness. We present the results of over a five-year period of monitoring of pests in the main city parks and private ornamental gardens in Bucharest. We detected 52 species of pests of urban vegetation. Each species locations and host plants are given. Eighteen of these species are alien to Romania Cameraria ohridella on Aesculus hippocastanum, Cydalima perspectalis on Buxus spp., Unaspis euonymi on Euonymus sp., Corythucha ciliata and Phyllonorycter platani on Platanus sp., Corythucha arcuata on Quercus sp., Pseudaulacaspis pentagona on Syringa vulgaris and Morus alba, Adelges piceae on Picea sp., Adelges abietis on Abies sp., Adelges laricis on Larix sp., Macrosiphoniella sanborni on Chrysanthemum sp., Aphis spiraephaga on Spiraea x vanhouttei, Halyomorpha halys, Nezara viridula, Hyphantria cunea, Metcalfa pruinosa, Tetranychus urticae, and Trialeurodes vaporariorum on numerous ornamental species. Twelve of the alien species are considered invasive. More detailed information is presented for six of the most destructive species and a single case of interception for a mite not present in Europe.

AB  - Urbanization is a leading cause of species extinction; however, interest in urban greenspaces as sites for conservation has grown considerably in recent decades, raising questions about the ability of these habitats to support desired wildlife. Our goal was to determine how distinct forms of urban greenspace and their landscape context influenced the species composition of ground-dwelling beetle communities. We examined the taxonomic and functional composition of Carabidae and Staphylinidae in urban vacant lots, urban farms, and planted urban prairies within the City of Cleveland, Ohio. Beetles were collected using pitfall traps across 23 sites. We found that the three habitats examined varied significantly in beetle composition, with several unique species found within each type of greenspace. Carabidae abundance and richness were greater in urban prairies and urban farms relative to vacant lots. The abundance and taxonomic richness of Staphylinidae were highest within urban farms. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCA revealed that both local features and landscape variables influenced beetle community assembly. Most beetle taxa were negatively associated with buildings within the surrounding 1-km landscape, whereas grass was the most important local habitat feature. Additionally, we found variation in the distribution of species traits among habitats; ecological traits such as moisture tolerance and dispersal capacity differed significantly among urban greenspaces. Most interesting from a conservation perspective was a greater abundance of brachypterous carabids found in urban prairies, which suggests that these habitats provide overwintering and breeding habitat for some beetle species. Our findings demonstrate that urban greenspaces play important roles in shaping arthropod diversity in cities, and maintaining habitats that vary in design and management is important for their conservation.

T2  - Annals of the Entomological Society of America
AB  - Landscape surroundings and local habitat management affect patterns of insect biodiversity. Knowing which landscape and local factors are more important for insect species diversity informs landscape and local scale land management, yet can be challenging to disentangle. We sought to identify 1) which landscape factors surrounding, and 2) which local habitat factors within urban community gardens influence patterns in lady beetle (Coccinellidae) abundance and species richness. We assessed lady beetle abundance and taxonomic diversity, garden habitat characteristics, and the surrounding landscape composition in 19 gardens over two consecutive years. We found that the amount of natural area surrounding gardens at 3 km was the strongest correlate of abundance and species richness. Specifically, gardens surrounded by less natural area (gardens embedded in more urban landscapes) had higher lady beetle abundance and richness. In gardens embedded in landscapes with more amounts of natural land, local habitat features such as ornamental abundance and crop diversity may become more important for maintaining lady beetle abundance and richness. Our results suggest that within more urban landscapes, lady beetles may aggregate and accumulate in relatively resource-rich habitats like gardens. Thus, urban landscape quality and local habitat management may all interact to shape lady beetle communities within gardens.

AB  - Hard coastal infrastructure such as breakwaters and seawalls are built according to engineering parameters of structural performance and cost efficiency. Especially in urban settings, they conflict with the diverse needs and values of other users and stakeholders, such as sustaining coastal ecosystem biodiversity and providing the public with open, accessible spaces for socialisation and recreation. The presented research explores how the discipline of landscape design can contribute to their evolution. Building on recent precedents in developing multi-functional, ecologically enhanced seawalls, it proposes the concept of the blue garden, and explores two of its key features bio-engineering the form and materiality of seawalls to enhance their performance as ecosystem service providers; and utilising computational fluid dynamics to poetically shape sea waves as a visual, aural and tactile landscape material to enhance its social and experiential value. It concludes with a pilot study that implements these principles for a specific urban site.

T2  - Ecological Engineering
AB  - The increasing popularity of green roof technology can contribute to urban sustainability and well-being in cities. However, there still is limited knowledge about the effect of substrate, especially composed from waste amendments, on plant species suitable for the extensive green roofs. Currently the urban agglomeration is characterized by a high degree of industrialization and modern agriculture, which contributes to the production of excessive amounts of various waste materials. The usage of locally available waste materials has many potential benefits, including reduced transportation costs, reduced waste disposal and preservation of natural aggregates. However, the waste has to meet many criteria, such as appropriate physical and chemical properties. The main purposes of green roofs in Poland are to create additional green space in dense urban area and to increase biodiversity, which could be done by using native plants (well adapted to local weather conditions). A 3-year study was carried out in Krakow using a pilot-scale roof system in field containers. Treatments included two substrates-a Si-waste substrate composed of locally available waste materials and a commercial substrate (control)-and three native xerothermic plant taxa Dianthus carthusianorum, Hieracium pilosella L. and Sedum acre L. The physicochemical properties of substrates, their stability over time and influence on plant nutrient status as well as the visual rating of plants measurements were examined. We observed a tendency to decrease the bulk density and pH value, and a significant increase in the organic matter content in both tested substrates during a subsequent year of the study. The plant nutrient status was similar in terms of macro-elements, regardless of the substrate used. In relation to elevated trace element concentrations in the Si-waste substrate, the amount of metals accumulated in the tissues of all tested taxa was relatively low. We concluded that waste substrate may be a valuable root environment for examined native species which can be successfully used in Europe on green roof plant communities.

T2  - PeerJ
AB  - Urbanization transforms undeveloped landscapes into built environments, causing changes in communities and ecological processes. Flying arthropods play important roles in these processes as pollinators, decomposers, and predators, and can be important in structuring food webs. The goal of this study was to identify associations between urbanization and the composition of communities of flying (and floating) arthropods within gardens and parks in a medium-sized mesic city. We predicted that flying arthropod abundance and diversity would respond strongly to percent impervious surface and distance to city center, measurements of urbanization. Flying arthropods were sampled from 30 gardens and parks along an urbanization gradient in Toledo, Ohio, during July and August 2016, using elevated pan traps. A variety of potential predictor variables were also recorded at each site. We collected a total of 2,369 individuals representing nine orders. We found that flying arthropod community composition was associated with percent impervious surface and canopy cover. Overall flying arthropod abundance was negatively associated with percent impervious surface and positively associated with distance to city center. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Araneae (spiders) were positively associated with distance to city center. Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera (flieS), and Araneae were negatively associated with', percent impervious surface. Both distance to city center and percent impervious surface are metrics of urbanization, and this study shows how these factors influence flying arthropod communities in urban gardens and city parks, including significant reductions in taxa that contain pollinators and predators important to urban agriculture and forestry. A variety of environmental factors also showed significant associations with responses (e.g. canopy cover and soil moisture), suggesting these factors may underlie or modulate the urbanization effects. More research is needed to determine mechanisms of change.

T2  - Environmental Entomology
AB  - As Midwestern (United States) cities experience population decline, there is growing interest in converting underutilized vacant spaces to agricultural production. Urban agriculture varies in area and scope, yet most growers use similar cultivation practices such as avoiding chemical control of crop pests. For community gardens and farms that sell produce commercially, effective pest suppression by natural enemies is important for both societal, economic, and marketing reasons. To gauge the amount of prey suppression at 28 urban food production sites, we measured removal of sentinel eggs and larvae of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), a caterpillar pest that defoliates Brassica. We investigated how landscape and local factors, such as scale of production, influence cabbage looper mortality caused by predators. Predators removed 50% of eggs and 25% of larvae over a 3-d period. Landscape factors did not predict mortality rates, and the amount of loss and damage to sentinel prey were similar across sites that differed in scale (residential gardens, community gardens, and farms). To confirm that removal of sentinel items was likely caused by natural enemies, we set up a laboratory assay that measured predation of cabbage looper eggs and larvae by several predators occurring in urban gardens. Lady beetles caused the highest mortality rates, suggesting their potential value for biocontrol; spiders and pirate bugs also consumed both eggs and larvae at high rates. Our results suggest that urban growers benefit from high consumption rates of cabbage looper eggs and larvae by arthropod predators.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - Complex landscapes with high resource availability can support more diverse natural enemy communities and better natural pest control by providing resources and facilitating organism dispersal. Moreover, in agricultural landscapes, local agroecosystem management can support biodiversity maintenance and pest control by adding resources in less complex landscapes with fewer resources. However, we lack an understanding of how local and landscape factors interact to affect natural enemy communities and their site fidelity to agroecosystems in urban landscapes (i.e., cityscapes). To better understand how local and landscape factors influence natural enemies in urban agroecosystems, we used urban community gardens as a model system to test if and how local resource manipulation and differences in cityscape quality affect natural enemy (ladybird beetles, parasitoid wasps) communities and their fidelity to urban habitats. We performed two manipulations. First, we added local floral resources in 6 of 12 gardens situated in different cityscapes to measure differences in natural enemy biodiversity. Second, in those 12 gardens, with and without resource additions, we manipulated populations of a common natural enemy, Hippodamia convergens, to assess fidelity to the gardens. Floral resource additions increased parasitoid abundance and changed community composition, but had little effect on ladybeetle abundance, richness or site fidelity. Rather, ladybeetle fidelity to gardens was lower in gardens in low quality cityscapes with high impervious cover. Cityscape quality influences natural enemies in and fidelity to gardens. Landscape-moderated biodiversity patterns observed in rural landscapes likely differ from urban contexts with implications for pest control.

AB  - Urban agroecosystems can provide habitat for biodiversity and can benefit human communities through urban food provisioning. Moreover, urban agroecosystems could be managed so as to optimize ecosystem services like natural pest control provided by trophic interactions between natural enemies and herbivores. As in other ecosystems, predation and parasitism regulate herbivores in urban settings, but less is known about the relative importance of direct and indirect effects at local and landscape scales in highly managed urban agroecosystems. We collected data on herbivore (cabbage aphid) density and parasitism ratios (proportion of parasitized aphid "mummies") in 25 community gardens in three counties in the California central coast, USA. We used structural equation modeling to examine the effects of direct factors (host plant characteristics and parasitism) and indirect factors (soil, garden, and landscape characteristics) on herbivore density changes at two time points in the growing season (June and August). Aphid density, but not parasitism, varied across counties over the season, and there was a strong negative relationship between aphid density and parasitism. Direct effects were strong drivers of aphid density but not parasitism. In June, aphid density increased with host plant volume but decreased with greater floral density, while parasitism was only influenced by aphid density. In August, host plant volume similarly positively affected aphid density, and soil water holding capacity increased host plant volume. In addition, host plant density had a strong negative effect on parasitism. Urban gardeners may be able to reduce aphid pest densities by increasing floral resource density and strategically spatially distributing host plants throughout garden beds, though these processes depend on the season. The indirect effects of soil water holding capacity on aphid densities further suggest a critical role of human management on pest populations and pest control services through soil amendments and irrigation.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Urban agroecosystems offer an opportunity to investigate the diversity and distribution of organisms that are conserved in city landscapes. This information is not only important for conservation efforts, but also has important implications for sustainable agricultural practices. Associated biodiversity can provide ecosystem services like pollination and pest control, but because organisms may respond differently to the unique environmental filters of specific urban landscapes, it is valuable to compare regions that have different abiotic conditions and urbanization histories. In this study, we compared the abundance and diversity of ladybird beetles within urban gardens in California and Michigan, USA. We asked what species are shared, and what species are unique to urban regions. Moreover, we asked how beetle diversity is influenced by the amount and rate of urbanization surrounding sampled urban gardens. We found that the abundance and diversity of beetles, particularly of unique species, respond in opposite directions to urbanization ladybirds increased with urbanization in California, but decreased with urbanization in Michigan. We propose that in California water availability in gardens and the urbanization history of the landscape could explain the divergent pattern. Thus, urban context is likely a key contributor to biodiversity within habitats and an important consideration for sustainable agricultural practices in urban agroecosystems.

AB  - Green roofs, especially productive ones (e.g. of edible biomass), are urban ecosystems developed in response to the scarcity of arable areas in urban environments. Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested a passive wind dispersal - the "flying" collembolans - and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.

AU  - Kim, Jinki
T2  - Landscape and Ecological Engineering
AB  - Recently, the green infrastructure (GI) concept has been adopted by many cities for stormwater management even though doubt still remains as to whether it can be fully embedded into planning and design. As many researchers have stated, GI planning has been discussed as offering a number of broad benefits in ecological, economic, and social spheres. The aim of this study is to examine the benefits of GI which can be used at various ranges of scale to support the principles of low impact development (LID). Case studies of two different scales, site scale and neighborhood scale, have shown ecological, social, and economic benefits of GI. The projects include GI elements and LID strategies such as green roof, rain barrels, porous pavement, rain garden, gravel grass, vegetated swales, and retention basins. The result indicates that GI elements are effective in detaining stormwater and reducing the amount of runoff. Native prairie grasses, sedges, and plantings also improved habitat value and led to a noticeable increase in birds, bees, and butterflies. The GI project provided outdoor activities, promoted social interaction, and showed a positive effect on economic spheres as well. Quantification of these benefits is important for landscape architects, planners, and policy makers because it can provide better strategies for GI planning.

AB  - Urban greenspaces including remnant patches of vegetation, backyard gardens and public parks provide important habitat for wildlife conservation. Maintaining and enhancing the conservation value of these spaces requires both an understanding of the biodiversity they support, and the factors, including habitat traits, influencing species occurrence. Roadside greenspaces, including road verges and median strips are often overlooked in current greenspace biodiversity studies. We quantified arthropod community assemblages in roadside and public park greenspaces, and determined if habitat complexity was an important trait influencing species composition in these areas. Using pitfall traps, we sampled ground dwelling arthropods along five major roads in the greater Sydney Region and in public parks. Whilst roadside greenspaces (road verges and median strips) and public parks supported significantly different arthropod assemblages, habitat complexity had no impact on community assemblage and neither factor affected the assemblage of key arthropods taxa including ants, beetles and spiders. Additionally, in public parks but not road side greenspaces we found an effect of habitat complexity on arthropod abundance; arthropods were more abundant in high complexity park sites. Our results highlight the unique arthropod community assemblage supported by roadside greenspaces, and suggest management practices like increasing habitat complexity may be important in some but not all urban greenspace types.

TI  - Herbivores and natural enemies of brassica crops in urban agriculture
AU  - Lowenstein, D M
AU  - Minor, E S
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban agriculture has been growing in popularity around the globe. As more land is allocated to urban agriculture, there is a greater need to understand arthropod herbivores and natural enemies in these sites. The area and production type of urban agriculture could influence the risk of pest outbreaks, since larger food production areas are hypothesized to host more abundant herbivore populations. To determine the potential for pest outbreaks, we sampled for pests and above-ground natural enemies at three types of sites with variable amounts of cultivated areas residential gardens, community gardens, and urban farms. We focused on pests of brassica, a widely cultivated crop family attacked by cabbageworms and aphids. We investigated the relationships of garden characteristics and surrounding land cover on natural enemies and herbivores of brassica. More herbivores and plant damage were expected in larger community gardens and urban farms. However, herbivore populations were low across sites and not explained by garden characteristics or area of production. Herbivory on brassica averaged less than 15% at all sites. Limited plant damage and low herbivore numbers may be attributed to the positive effects of garden flowers on parasitoids and high numbers of parasitoids and generalist predators across sites. Garden area and floral resources had positive relationships with natural enemy abundance, although community composition was similar across sites. Since arthropod natural enemies were abundant across all types of food production, this suggests that urban agriculture is a beneficial habitat that could support regulating ecosystem services such as biological control.

T2  - Frontiers in Plant Science
AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI) definition, deriving from the United States green infrastructure for hydro-geological rebalancing through imitating the nature stormwater management, was consolidated in Europe by GI Planning Guide. Nowadays GI can be considered a valid and meaningful approach for ameliorating urban complex ecosystems, and could also be considered as mitigation action of land consumption, according to the guidelines on the soil sealing of the European Commission (2012). The metropolitan area of Naples located in south Italy is characterized by an unauthorized and chaotic urban development. The land-use map reported an average of 30% of urbanization in the metropolitan area, rising up to 50-60% and as high as 98% in the north core area of the city. This high level of urbanization is directly related to the habitat fragmentation. The National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy defines several challenges and targets to counteract the biodiversity loss in Italy, identifying urban areas as places exposed to the greatest pressures on ecosystems. Therefore, the integration of different policies limiting habitat fragmentation, heat island effect and natural soil hydro-geological degradation into spatial planning, especially through green corridors and ecosystem enhancement in urban areas is an urgent need for the society. Spatial planning has to be renewed in metropolitan areas, where threats and weaknesses to biodiversity conservation are stronger than in any other place, according to the Law n. 56/2014, (Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica ltaliana, 2014) committing metropolitan cities to the enactment of General Territorial Plan. In the current paper, we aim at designing an ecological network for the metropolitan area of Naples one of the biggest city of southern Italy. The analyses include the adopted methodological procedure, i.e., ecological network analysis and design, and the introductory elements of a spatial analysis on a pilot ecological network of several patches. Finally, the paper illustrates the network analysis conceived as a monitoring system and also in future perspective, as a planning support system.

T2  - Climate
AB  - Climatically similar regions may experience different temperature extremes and weather patterns that warrant global comparisons of local microclimates. Urban agroecosystems are interesting sites to examine the multidimensional impacts of climate changes because they rely heavily on human intervention to maintain crop production under different and changing climate conditions. Here, we used urban community gardens across the California Central Coast metropolitan region, USA, and the Melbourne metropolitan region, Australia, to investigate how habitat-scale temperatures differ across climatically similar regions, and how people may be adapting their gardening behaviors to not only regional temperatures, but also to the local weather patterns around them. We show that, while annual means are very similar, there are strong interregional differences in temperature variability likely due to differences in the scale and scope of the temperature measurements, and regional topography. However, the plants growing within these systems are largely the same. The similarities may be due to gardeners' capacities to adapt their gardening behaviors to reduce the adverse effects of local temperature variability on the productivity of their plot. Thus, gardens can serve as sites where people build their knowledge of local weather patterns and adaptive capacity to climate change and urban heat. Climate-focused studies in urban landscapes should consider how habitat-scale temperature variability is a background for interesting and meaningful social-ecological interactions.

AB  - Urban biotic homogenization is one of the foremost challenges for conservation of biodiversity in urban green areas. Urban gardening is a common practice in many industrialised and developing countries. The ability of urban vegetable gardens to support biodiversity, however, has yet to be studied in depth. To investigate the responses of flora and soil fauna to urbanization, we surveyed the taxonomic and functional composition of plant and collembolan communities, in addition to soil parameters, in 15 urban vegetable gardens across three large French cities. The vegetation was identified in six plots of 1x1 m in each urban vegetable garden and collembolan were extracted from one intact soil core sampled in the center of each plot (5cm depth, 6cm diameter). We found contrasting effects of urbanization on plants and Collembola biodiversity. The taxonomic and functional composition of the soil fauna was more similar within cities than among cities, which was driven by similarities in soil parameters. In contrast, plant communities were functionally similar among cities. Understanding the effects of urbanization on soil biodiversity could have implications for the management of urban ecosystems, in particular that of urban soils.

T2  - Science of the Total Environment
AB  - Urban environments are being subject to increasing temperatures due to the combined effects of global climate change and urban heat. These increased temperatures, coupled with human planting preferences and green space management practices, influence how urban plants grow and survive. Urban community gardens are an increasingly popular land use, and a green space type that is influenced by unique climate-human behavior interactions. Despite ongoing rapid temperature changes in cities, it is unknown how gardeners are adapting to these changes, and to what extent changes influence planting decisions and patterns of urban plant diversity. In this
study, we monitored the variation in daily air temperatures and measured plant species richness at the garden and garden plot scale in 11 community gardens in Melbourne, Australia. We surveyed N180 gardeners to better understand the relationships between temperature variation, garden plant species diversity, and gardener management practices. We found that garden scale temperature variability is driven by regional context, and temperatures are more stable in landscapes with higher impervious surface cover. Gardeners agreed that climatic/temperature changes are influencing their watering behavior, but not their plant selection. Instead plant selection is being driven by desired food production. Yet, when comparing two bioregions, temperature did have a measurable relationship with garden plant composition in the region with more temperature variation. Temperature variability negatively related to plant species richness within garden plots, providing evidence that plant survival is related to climate at this scale in such regions. Although gardeners may be able to water more in response to regional climate changes, gardeners are unlikely to be able to completely control the effects of temperature on plant survival in more variable conditions. This suggests the inner city with more stable temperatures (albeit potentially hotter for longer due to heat island) may accommodate more species diverse gardens

AB  - Subsistence farming in urban gardens may be a strategy for food and nutrition security, particularly in socially disadvantaged families, because it eases access to food. This study aimed to assess the following factors in socially disadvantaged families (1) prevalence of food insecurity, (2) characterization of gardens and cultivation of edible plants in urban areas, and (3) relation between characteristics of urban gardens and cultivated edible plants and food security in families. A survey was conducted on the management and cultivation of plants in gardens and on the perception of food security according to the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale for 118 families living in urban areas in the municipality of Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. We observed that 78.8% of families were exposed to food insecurity and were socially vulnerable. Among these, 56.8% experienced mild food insecurity conditions, 15.3% moderate conditions, and 6.7% severe conditions. Management of urban gardens and cultivation of edible plants vary widely according to families' needs and interests, available space, age of farmers, cultivation time, and previous relationship between the family and rural environments. There was no relation between characteristics of gardens, management, and cultivation of edible plants in urban gardens and the perception of food security of socially disadvantaged families.

AB  - ContextAs urban areas increase in extent globally, domestic yards play an increasingly important role as potential contributors to ecosystem services and well-being. These benefits largely depend on the plant species richness and composition of yards.ObjectivesWe aim to determine the factors that drive plant species richness and phylogenetic composition of cultivated and spontaneous flora in urban yards at the continental scale, and how these potential drivers interact.MethodsWe analyzed plant species richness and phylogenetic composition of cultivated and spontaneous flora of 117 private yards from six major metropolitan areas in the US. Yard plant species richness and phylogenetic composition were expressed as a function of biophysical and socioeconomic variables and yard characteristics using linear mixed-effects models and spatially explicit structural equation modeling.ResultsExtreme temperatures largely determined yard species richness and phylogenetic composition at the continental scale. Precipitation positively predicted spontaneous richness but negatively predicted cultivated richness. Only the phylogenetic composition of the spontaneous flora was associated with precipitation. The effect of lower temperatures and precipitation on all yard diversity parameters was partly mediated by yard area. Among various socioeconomic variables, only education level showed a significant effect on cultivated phylogenetic composition.ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that irrigation compensates for precipitation in driving cultivated yard plant diversity at the continental scale. Socioeconomic variables among middle and upper class families have no apparent influence on yard diversity. These findings inform the adaptation of US urban vegetation in cities in the face of global change.

AB  - Cultivation and spread of non-native plant species may result in either phylogenetic homogenization (increasing similarity) or differentiation (decreasing similarity) of urban floras. However, it is unknown how non-native species influence homogenization of cultivated versus spontaneously occurring species in cities, and which traits are associated with species that promote homogenization versus differentiation. In this study, we compared homogenization effects of cultivated and spontaneous non-native species in yard floras across and within seven widely distributed U.S. cities. Additionally, we explored which traits explained their particular contribution to homogenization. We recorded plant presence/absence in 178 private yards distributed among seven metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. We compared phylogenetic homogenization effects of non-native species within both the cultivated and spontaneous species pools using phylogenetic dissimilarities and the homogenization index. Then, we expressed contributions of non-native species to the homogenization of each pool as a function of two different sets of plant functional traits using phylogenetic generalized least square (PGLS) models across and within cities. Across cities, spontaneous non-native species homogenized, and cultivated non-native species differentiated, yard floras. Within the spontaneous pool, short, small-seeded non-native plants and non-native grasses significantly homogenized yard floras. Within the cultivated pool, species contribution to homogenization was best predicted by plant height, presence of showy flowers, and growth form, with non-native grasses significantly homogenizing cultivated yard floras. Within cities, non-native species-whether they were cultivated or spontaneous- consistently homogenized yard floras of the three northern cities and differentiated yard floras of three of the four southern cities, suggesting that homogenization processes are context- and scale-dependent. Likewise, traits explaining homogenization differed substantially among cities. The inconsistent patterns among cities in the plant traits that promoted homogenization of both cultivated and spontaneous species suggest that local environmental and anthropogenic conditions of individual cities imposed strong constraints on trait selection. Linking plant functional traits that promote homogenization with residents' preferences for vegetation may further enhance understanding of how yard plant communities assemble at regional and local scales.

AB  - The expansion of cities and agricultural plantations have unpredictable impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet some species are capable of tolerating anthropogenic impacts and continue to provide ecological services in highly disturbed landscapes. The objective of this study was to use DNA barcoding to identify digested plant materials and seeds in the faeces of frugivorous bats (Cynopterus brachyotis) and investigate whether (1) C. brachyotis in urban and agricultural areas exploit cultivated and exotic plants as a novel food resource and as a consequence, potentially facilitate the invasion of cultivated and exotic plants, or whether (2) C. brachyotis exploit native plants and as a consequence, potentially promote forest regeneration. A native species, Ficus fistulosa, was the most frequently detected plant and the seeds were found in bat faeces from all sampling sites suggesting the potential of fruit bats in dispersing seeds. However, we also detected several exotic plants in the faeces of C. brachyotis which suggests that the fruit bats exploit novel food resources at all sites. We recorded a diverse diet of C. brachyotis at an oil palm plantation which indicated that the fruit bats are not predominantly feeding on oil palm fruits. By using DNA barcoding, we detected plants that have not been reported in previous studies of the diet of C. brachyotis, although we could not identify which part of the plant was being consumed by the fruit bats. Given the varied diet of C. brachyotis, the potential of this bat to adapt to changing landscapes is high and they are likely dispersing seeds of native pioneer plants (Ficus).

T2  - Economic Botany
AB  - Our research involves of how Paraguayan migrants who are living in Misiones, Argentina, manage medicinal plants in home gardens, and how this practice can be related to the landscape. We examine the relationship between the richness of home garden medicinal plants and landscape variables (e.g., distance to the forest) by applying PLS analysis, which combines principal component analysis with linear regression. We surveyed 60 home gardens localized in a rural area, and we characterized the surrounding landscape with geospatial tools. Paraguayans' home gardens are extremely diverse sites (total of 136 medicinal species), where both native (82) and introduced species (50) are managed. People who live close to the native forest or mixed use areas (e.g., farms, secondary vegetation) tend to possess less native plants in their gardens because they are available nearby. While gardeners, who live in proximity to tree crops (e.g., pine plantations), have reduced access to wild medicinal resources; therefore, their effort is concentrated on maintaining native plants. These results reflect a relationship between accessibility to medicinal plants in the landscape and the management practices in the home gardens, a neglected driver in explaining the richness and composition of the medicinal plants in home gardens so far. Thus, we contributed evidence in support of the environmental scarcity compensation hypothesis. Finally, our study supports the idea that home gardens appear to function as a springboard for plant domestication.

T2  - Journal of Ethnobiology
AB  - Polish allotment gardeners, who cultivate publicly owned urban space, constitute the largest group of city land managers in the country. Although research on allotment gardens in Poland exists, detailed studies about the uses of cultivated plants are absent. The aims of this study are to document plant richness and diversity of allotment-garden use and to explore the (changing) purpose of such gardens. Interviews, guided walks, and plant inventories were done, conducted among 46 urban allotment gardeners in three Polish cities in 2009. We documented 257 botanical taxa; the great majority were used as ornamentals (191 taxa), followed by food (66) and medicinal plants (5). However, names of edible varieties were rarely reported. In addition, very few protected and invasive species were registered in our study. Polish urban gardeners are attached to traditional food and ornamental plants (core repertoire), but they also show a moderate interest in novel plants (peripheral fashion). We observed an important shift in urban allotment garden management in Poland. Until the collapse of Communism, in the late 1980s, they had a chiefly productive character and today they are becoming more akin to pleasure gardens.

AB  - The contemporary renaissance of urban agriculture is crucially linking ecological and social systems in modern cityscapes. Community gardens contribute ecological (biodiversity conservation) and social (food security) benefits to urban residents and enhance landscape multifunctionality. Cities have been recently labeled "novel ecosystems" because of the multiscalar interaction of sociocultural and biophysical elements. We conceptualize community garden soils within the novel ecosystem framework, arguing that gardeners are cultivating novel agroecosystems starting from their garden beds' soil. Although urban soil characteristics are linked to land-use legacies in most urban ecosystems, we find that in our system, the California central coast, community-garden soils may live outside the influence of legacies associated with geographic location. Instead, the intensive (re) working of soils by gardeners may washout legacy signals and decadal chronological trends, leading to soil homogenization that reduces the biophysical ties to the meters of earth below. Thus, socioecological novelty can be created in multiple forms in cities.

AB  - Urban agriculture is well known for its multifunctionality. In Africa, it can contribute to food security and poverty reduction. Often associated with urban gardening, and urban livestock, there is a gap of knowledge on the urban production of aromatic and medicinal plants. This production is present in Ziguinchor, Senegal, where the study has been conducted. The objective of this article is to describe this form of urban agriculture in order to evaluate its environmental and socioeconomic services. The method is based on mapping of agricultural sites in the city, and on a survey of 70 producers. The results show that these micro-farms are localized in urban interstices. The land tenure is based on free leases, from landowners who can take back their land at any time. The cultivated species are Mentha spicata L., Mentha X piperita L. and Ocimum basilicum L. The cultivation of these plants is the work of women who get a significant income. These revenues are mainly intended for the purchase of food and the schooling of children. In addition to reducing poverty, these micro-farms contribute to the sanitation of the city, considering the fertilization coming from waste and animal manure. Mints have other properties, in particular medicinal, underestimated by the producers. In spite of these assets, this activity is limited in its development whereas solutions of technical improvement and commercial valorization would be possible.

AB  - The conservation of pineapple in urban backyards is an innovative strategy that aims to involve city residents. A program of this nature requires careful planning and monitoring because of the involvement of people who do not have technical knowledge. This paper reports the implementation and evaluation of 30 gardens in urban backyards in Cabaceiras do Paraguacn, Bahia, Brazil, to establish the parameters to allow creating a model for pineapple germplasm conservation cells with the collaboration of urban residents. A questionnaire was applied in two steps to people interested in participating, from which it was possible to choose and evaluate a general profile of the participants. Thirty pineapple accessions from the Active Germplasm Bank (AGB) of the Embrapa were selected for testing in the gardens. Two production cycles were considered, during which quantitative and qualitative traits of the plants and fruits were evaluated. The data were compared with the characteristics of the same accessions in the Pineapple AGB and were analysed by mixed principal component analysis. With respect to adequate maintenance, 20 gardens were well cared for until the end of the assessments, five were reasonably well tended and five were lost, due to home remodelling or lack of care by the guardians. Despite the loss of the five gardens, no accession was totally lost, thanks to the experimental design with three plants of each accession in three different gardens. The plants preserved in the gardens did not differ from those maintained by the AGB, demonstrating the effectiveness of this conservation strategy.

AB  - Homegardens are small-scale agroforestry systems consisting of parcels of land on homesteads in which diverse plant species are cultivated in several strata, often integrating herbaceous, tree, vine, crop, and animal components. Among the vines in Mayan homegardens in Yucatan is the pitahaya (Hylocereus undatus), a cactus with edible fruit. We use this species as a model to identify changes in the level of knowledge and management of homegardens due to modernization (increased tourism, paved roads, and urban expansion) in order to propose conservation strategies. Structured interviews were carried out in 100 homegardens; information regarding economics, language, school attendance, and the distance to cities were gathered. Currently, pitahaya is mostly eaten as a sorbet, and women harvest its fruit more often than men do. It is the elderly who teach the next generations about the use and care of pitahayas. The model that best explained the level of knowledge and management about pitahaya included variables such as the location of homegardens; their distance to the nearest city; as well as language, gross domestic product, and school attendance rate of home gardeners. We found that there is less traditional knowledge about pitahayas when home gardeners have higher school attendance and that not only pitahayas but also homegardens near cities are being neglected. We suggest that conservation planning for pitahayas and homegardens should include education programs on their ecological, nutritional, and economic importance. Homegardens, whose owners have the highest level of knowledge about their management and biodiversity, should be interactively conserved, and the knowledge of home gardeners should be acknowledged.

AB  - Urban gardens in Central California are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, experiencing both extended high heat periods as well as water restrictions because of severe drought conditions. This puts these critical community-based food production systems at risk as California is expected to experience increasing weather extremes. In agricultural systems, increased vegetation complexity, such as greater structure or biodiversity, can increase the resilience of food production systems from climate fluctuations. We test this theory in 15 urban gardens across California's Central Coast. Local- and landscape-scale measures of ground, vegetation, and land cover were collected in and around each garden, while climate loggers recorded temperatures in each garden in 30min increments. Multivariate analyses, using county as a random factor, show that both local- and landscape-scale factors were important. All factors were significant predictors of mean temperature. Tallest vegetation, tree/shrub species richness, grass cover, mulch cover, and landscape level agricultural cover were cooling factors; in contrast, garden size, garden age, rock cover, herbaceous species richness, and landscape level urban cover were warming factors. Results were similar for the maximum temperature analysis except that agriculture land cover and herbaceous species richness were not significant predictors of maximum temperature. Analysis of gardener watering behavior to observed temperatures shows that garden microclimate was significantly related to the number of minutes watered as well as the number of liters of water used per watering event. Thus gardeners seem to respond to garden microclimate in their watering behavior even though this behavior is most probably motivated by a range of other factors such as water regulations and time availability. This research shows that local management of ground cover and vegetation can reduce mean and maximum temperatures in gardens, and the reduced temperatures may influence watering behavior of gardeners

AB  - Private yards provide city residents with access to ecosystem services that can be realized through passive (vegetation availability) and active (time spent in yards: frequency and duration) means. However, urban densification is leading to smaller yards with less vegetation. Here, we examine how urban form and socio-demographic factors affect the potential ecosystem service benefits people can gain via passive (e.g. Climate regulation) and active (e.g. recreation) pathways. Two measures of vegetation cover (0.15–2 m, >2 m) are used as a proxy for passive ecosystem service benefits, and two measures of yard use (use frequency, total time spent across a week) are used for active ecosystem service benefits. We use survey and GIS data to measure personal and physical predictors that could influence these variables for 520 residents of detached housing in Brisbane, Australia. We found house age and yard size were positively correlated with vegetation cover, and people with a greater nature relatedness and lower socio-economic disadvantage also had greater vegetation cover. Yard size was an important predictor of yard use, as was nature relatedness, householder age, and presence of children in the home. Vegetation cover showed no relationship, indicating that greater cover alone does not promote ecosystem service delivery through the active use pathway. Together our results show that people who have higher nature relatedness may receive greater benefits from their yards via both passive and active means as they have more vegetation available to them in their yards and they interact with this space more frequently and for longer time
periods.

AB  - Despite their importance both in soil functioning and as soil indicators, the response of microarthropods to various land uses is still unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of land use on microarthropod diversity and determine whether a soil's biological quality follows the same physicochemical quality-based gradient from forest, agriculture-grassland, agriculture-arable land, vineyards, urban vegetable gardens to urban, industrial, traffic, mining and military areas. A database compiling the characteristics of 758 communities has been established. We calculated Collembola community indices including species richness, Pielou's evenness index, collembolan life forms, the abundance of Collembola and of Acari, the Acari/Collembola abundance ratio, and the Collembolan ecomorphological index. Results show that agricultural land use was the most harmful for soil microarthropod biodiversity, whilst urban and industrial land uses give the same level of soil biological quality as forests do. Furthermore, differences between the proportions of Acari and ecomorphological groups were observed between land uses. This study, defining soil microarthropod diversity baselines for current land uses, should therefore help in managing and preserving soil microarthropod biodiversity, especially by supporting the preservation of soil quality.

AB  - The urban domestic gardens that are part of urban green areas have become a very important element due to their ecosystematic benefits and the poor information about them. Information regarding the floristic richness of three socioeconomic stratifications from the city of Heredia, Costa Rica is presented in this study. Research was conducted from October 2011 to May 2012. Information was collected using a semistructured questionnaire, which was provided to 61 garden owners, including the owner's personal data, time living in the dwelling, area of the property and the garden, variation of its size in time and the garden's location on the property. In addition, a floristic inventory was conducted in each garden as well as a taxonomic identification of all plants. Vegetative forms and substrates were also noted. Characteristics of the gardens and their owners were then analyzed to determine the relationship of species richness between the three sites studied. The number of plant species recorded was 618, corresponding to 102 families (19 % exotic). Regarding geographical origin, 64, 4 % were exotic, 35,6 % native. Orchidaceae (93 spp.) and Araceae (39 spp.) were the most dominant families. The variables of garden area and location and owner's age determined the garden's floristic richness. In addition, the garden's area and vegetative forms varied among the sites studied probably due to socioeconomic differences among them. Diversity of pioneer plants increased with the garden's area. In sum, this research provides important floristic information of domestic gardens, since, being private property, data about them is scarce and municipal management guidelines are nonexistent.

AB  - Home gardens have received increasing attention and have been insistently presented as hotspots for agro-biodiversity over the last decades. However, apart from their exceptional high plant species diversity, there is little quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of plant species conservation in home gardens. This study examined this issue by assessing (i) the size and membership of garden flora and the contribution to the maintenance of the national flora, (ii) how home garden flora connects to the larger ecosystem it belongs to and (iii) the conservation status of plant species at the home garden level. 360 home gardens distributed in three agro-ecological zones and nine phyto-geographical districts in Benin were visited and inventoried. Diversity parameters at different taxonomic levels were calculated. Species accumulation and spatial occupancy, multivariate methods and rarity index were also used for data analysis. Findings showed that the 360 studied home gardens hosted up to 14.21% of plant species and 44.32% of plant families of the national flora. Home garden flora was constantly dominated by exotic plant species but strongly connected to their surrounding ecosystems, being composed of at least 60% of plant species from their phyto-geographical districts. Finally, home garden plant species were mostly rare and threatened at the home garden level. In this study, we acknowledge the contribution of home gardens to the maintenance of plant species diversity at regional and global levels than local level. Based on the observed prevalence of exotic species, HG effectiveness in sustainably conserving native plant species biodiversity remains questionable.

AB  - Allotment gardens and community gardens provide important ecosystem services to urban communities, such as local climate and water regulation, as well as habitat provision for biodiversity. Using the city of Leipzig as a case study, we assess the effect of urban gardening type and intensity of management on ecosystem services and biodiversity by comparing allotment and community gardens. Employing a stratified sampling design, we assessed 30 allotment plots of different management intensity, including vacant plots, and six adjacent community gardens along a gradient of urbanity, using in-depth field surveys, remote sensing analyses and interviews. Our results show a bimodal relationship of overall vascular plant species richness with management intensity with highest species richness in medium intensively-managed plots, as they provide space for both cultivated edible and ornamental species as well as native, spontaneous species. In comparison to allotment gardens, community gardens provide a higher ratio of permeable soil surface and a slightly higher microbial soil activity, implying important differences in water regulation and nutrient cycling properties. With regard to climate regulation, old mature trees make a considerable contribution to above ground carbon storage, but are largely restricted to communal areas of the allotment estates due to code regulation. Based on our results, we discuss the impact of allotment gardening association codes and garden type and ways forward for gardeners and urban planners to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services provision.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Allotment gardens are a key feature of the urban landscape, providing numerous benefits beyond those of food production. These include ecosystem services such as local climate modification, pollination, and providing a pleasant location for socialising. The biodiversity of flora underpins many of these ecosystem services. The aims of this study are to assess the spontaneous vascular flora of urban allotment gardens and derive estimates of the species richness and diversity. In doing so, the specific position of allotment gardens within urban green infrastructure will be revealed and the role of allotment users in shaping local biodiversity determined. 358 species of spontaneous flora were recorded in 11 representative allotment garden estates (total area 150 ha) in PoznaA", Poland. Fourteen biodiversity features were taken into account. The investigated areas exhibited high plant species richness, high diversity, low synanthropisation level, and contained valuable geobotanical elements, including plants of key importance for the European Community. For these reasons, allotment gardens should be considered as biodiversity hotspots for native species within urban green infrastructure. Based on an analysis of the spatial and functional organization of 110 individual plots, four types of usage, and corresponding plant diversity have been distinguished. The composition of the flora depends mostly on spatial and functional organization of allotment gardens and, to a much lesser extent, on the habitat conditions, which on individual plots varied very little. The high species richness and diversity in allotment gardens has important consequences for urban planning.

AB  - Among the agricultural environments of traditional communities, home gardens are frequently cited as high agrobiodiversity sites. However, the agrobiodiversity of home gardens along a rural-urban gradient demands study in order to identify possible influences of urbanization and to support mitigation of impacts. The present work investigated the role home gardens play in the in situ agrobiodiversity conservation of plants in quilombola communities with different degrees of urbanization. The study found that more urbanized communities have larger home gardens, but the average richness of plant species in these areas was not statistically different among the communities. Furthermore, the abundance of plant species was similar. Medicinal and food plants were mainly found in home gardens of the communities with high to intermediate levels of urbanization, while ornamental plants were more common in rural community home gardens. It is believed that crop exclusivity in home gardens of the more urbanized communities highly influenced the results, increasing the role home gardens play in maintaining traditional practices. The elevated and statistically equal species richness in home gardens suggests that, despite the factors generated by urbanization, all of the communities are very important for in situ conservation of native and introduced species.

AB  - Urban neighborhoods vary in development intensity and in the life style and demographics of their residents. Decisions made by urban residents affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial, ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by neighborhood socioeconomics.

T2  - Economic Botany
AB  - Contemporary germplasm conservation studies largely focus on ex situ and in situ management of diversity within centers of genetic diversity. Transnational migrants who transport and introduce landraces to new locations may catalyze a third type of conservation that combines both approaches. Resulting populations may support reduced diversity as a result of evolutionary forces such as genetic drift, selection, and gene flow, yet they may also be more diverse as a result of multiple introductions, selective breeding and cross pollination among multiple introduced varietals. In this study, we measured the amount and structure of maize molecular genetic diversity in samples collected from home gardens and community gardens maintained by immigrant farmers in Southern California. We used the same markers to measure the genetic diversity and structure of commercially available maize varieties and compared our data to previously reported genetic diversity statistics of Mesoamerican landraces. Our results reveal that transnational dispersal creates an opportunity for the maintenance of maize genetic diversity beyond its recognized centers of diversity.

AB  - This 1-year study, extending from January to December 2011, was conducted to investigate the role of the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) as a seed disperser in Lahore, Pakistan. Ejecta of the species from two roosting sites, i.e. Jinnah garden and Lalazar garden, was collected and the plant seeds were extracted from bat boluses and guano. Various seeds of edible trees and forest plantation species extracted from ejecta of P. giganteus included areca palm (Areca catechu), coromandel ebony (Diospyros melanoxylon), Indian gaabh (D. peregrina), lemon-scented gum (Eucalyptus citriodora), Chinese fan palm (Livistona chinensis), sapodilla (Manilkara zapota),
mahwa (Madhuca longifolia), Indian lilac (Melia azedarach), cajeput tree (Melaleuca eucadendra), rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), guava (Psidium guajava), and janbolanum plum (Syzygium jambolanum). Measurements of the extracted seeds’ length (mm), diameter (mm), and weight (g) were taken and the seeds of jack fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) were found the longest (40 mm) with the maximum average diameter (50 mm) while the rambutan (N. lappaceum) seeds were the heaviest (3.4 g). It can be concluded from the present study that P. giganteus is a seed disperser and transporter of heavier seeds as heavier seeds are mammal-dependent for their
dispersal.

AB  - Urban sprawl along the Mediterranean coast is characterized by single-family houses and domestic gardens. Many new residences are secondary homes for socio-demographically diverse tourists. We explore the differences between the residence types in terms of their garden structures and plant compositions using socioeconomic and legacy attributes. Outdoor areas of 245 primary and secondary homes were investigated to determine plant compositions, land cover and household characteristics. Then, the outdoor land cover was compared between the two residence types. Vector fitting in ordination space assessed the influences of socioeconomic and legacy effects on plant compositions. Finally, generalized linear models (GLMs) assessed the influence of these variables on garden structures. Relevant differences exist in the plant compositions of primary and secondary residences. Furthermore, secondary residences have larger areas of trees, shrubs, flowers and swimming pools, while vegetable gardens are more common at primary residences. Overall, socioeconomic effects appeared to strongly constrain the features of household gardens.

AB  - Homegardens (HG) can play a key role in the conservation of plant diversity and at the same time provide ecosystem services that have a direct and positive impact on human welfare. The relationships among plant diversity, ecosystem services, and the factors that influence them formed the subject of study in tropical HG in Sangay, Ecuador. We compiled information from 138 HG in 11 localities and found 484 plant species associated with 20 ecosystem services, the most important of which, according to interviews with the gardeners, provide food, medicine and ornamentation. Influential physical factors on plant diversity in the HG were altitude, precipitation and temperature, while socioeconomic factors, including ethnicity, gender, income and education, were perhaps more important determinants of HG diversity. Three groups of HG were identified by Hierarchical Ascendant Correspondence Analysis "small HG of recent origin," having the fewest species and ecosystem services, "large, transitional HG," having a wide range of services, and "medium, established HG," mainly supplying food, medicine, ornamentation, shade and fencing. Ethnicity may be a stronger determinant of differences in HG composition for Shuar people, HG were a main source of food, critical to their subsistence in rural areas; in total, Shuar gardeners cultivated on the whole more plant species. On the other hand, HG belonging to mestizos were more diverse, have more exotic plant species, and provide mainly cultural and regulatory services. HG in more urban settings mainly provided ornamentation, fencing and shade. This information can be applied by policy makers to the design of strategies for biodiversity conservation and food security.

AB  - Context Urban community gardens are globally prevalent urban agricultural areas and have the potential to fulfill human needs in impoverished neighborhoods, such as food security and access to open space. Despite these benefits, little research has been conducted evaluating environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing community garden plant biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES). Objective Our study investigated the drivers of managed plant richness, abundance, and ES production in community gardens across Los Angeles County, CA from 2010 to 2012 at regional, garden, and plot scales. Methods Fourteen community gardens were visited in the summers of 2010-2012 for comprehensive species surveys across regional, garden, and plot scales. We compared biodiversity to household income, plot size, and gardener ethnicity. Results In total, 707 managed plant species were recorded in summer surveys over a 3-year period. Ornamental plant richness increased with neighborhood income, while edible and medicinal richness increased with size of garden plots. Gardener ethnicity also influenced the composition of managed species, especially edible species. Conclusions We explain these patterns through a hierarchy of needs framework; gardeners preferentially plant species progressively less connected to human need. Ornamental plant increases in high-income regions may be explained by their requirement for financial investment and maintenance time. Cultural and provisioning ES are important for immigrant populations, resulting in ethnically distinct crop assemblages. Finally, distinct species-area relationships imply high demand for food abundance and biodiversity. Our quantitative results indicate that community gardens contribute to a biologically diverse urban ecosystem and provide valued ecosystem services in food insecure regions.

AB  - Urban greenery provides ecosystem services that play an important role in the challenging context of urban deprivation and poverty. This study assesses the social importance of vegetation through empirical assessment of 44 urban slums in the rapidly developing southern city of Bangalore, India. Vegetation played a major role in supporting nutrition by its role in food consumption, and in promoting health through the planting of species with medicinal use. Trees in slums also formed nodes for social activities including conversing and playing, domestic activities such as cooking and washing dishes, and livelihood activities such as the manufacture of broomsticks and tyre repair. Innovative methods of gardening were widely adopted, with kitchen gardens found planted in plastic bags, paint cans, old kitchen utensils and buckets, indicating the importance given to planting in environments with limited finances. Short and narrow trunked trees with medium-sized canopies and high economic value, such as Pongamia, were preferred. A greater focus on greening in slums is needed, and can provide an invaluable, inexpensive and sustainable approach to improve lives in these congested, deprived environments.

AB  - 1. Modern agriculture, in seeking to maximize yields to meet growing global food demand, has caused loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) and compaction, impairing critical regulating and supporting ecosystem services upon which humans also depend. Own-growing makes an important contribution to food security in urban areas globally, but its effects on soil qualities that underpin ecosystem service provision are currently unknown. 2. We compared the main indicators of soil quality; SOC storage, total nitrogen (TN), C N ratio and bulk density (BD) in urban allotments to soils from the surrounding agricultural region, and between the allotments and other urban greenspaces in a typical UK city. A questionnaire was used to investigate allotment management practices that influence soil properties. 3. Allotment soils had 32% higher SOC concentrations and 36% higher C N ratios than pastures and arable fields and 25% higher TN and 10% lower BD than arable soils. 4. There was no significant difference between SOC concentration in allotments and urban non-domestic greenspaces, but it was higher in domestic gardens beneath woody vegetation. Allotment soil C N ratio exceeded that in non-domestic greenspaces, but was lower than that in garden soil. 5. Three-quarters of surveyed allotment plot holders added manure, 95% composted biomass on-site, and many added organic-based fertilizers and commercial composts. This may explain the maintenance of SOC, C N ratios, TN and low BD, which are positively associated with soil functioning. 6. Synthesis and applications. Maintenance and protection of the quality of our soil resource is essential for sustainable food production and for regulating and supporting ecosystem services upon which we depend. Our study establishes, for the first time, that small-scale urban food production can occur without the penalty of soil degradation seen in conventional agriculture, and maintains the high soil quality seen in urban greenspaces. Given the involvement of over 800 million people in urban agriculture globally, and its important contribution to food security, our findings suggest that to better protect soil functions, local, national and international urban planning and policy making should promote more urban own-growing in preference to further intensification of conventional agriculture to meet increasing food demand.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Home gardens have been recognized as repositories of agricultural biodiversity across the world. The influence of socioeconomics and location-specific factors on urban gardening patterns merits continued study. Using Beijing Municipal Province in China, a rapidly urbanizing region, as a case study, we address two questions 1) How do biodiversity patterns change between different urbanized regions in Beijing? 2) How do ecosystem services provided by Beijing home gardens change with socioeconomic status and location-based preferences of gardeners? We surveyed 104 home gardens in Beijing Municipal Province for plant biodiversity, abundance, and species ecosystem services (ES) (provisioning or cultural uses). The gardens were distributed across three urbanized regions (suburban, peri-urban, and exurban). We found that species biodiversity and abundance shift according to a hierarchy of need from ornamentals (cultural ES) to edibles (provisioning ES) with increasing distance from Beijing. These trends are related to reduced income, lowered food security, and lack of urban markets in exurban regions. Rarefaction curves indicate ornamental species drive beta diversity. Ordination also showed a shift in species composition with increasing isolation from the city; Suburban and exurban gardens were the most different, while peri-urban gardens were similar to both others. Only exurban gardens had a positive relationship between species and area. High edible cover and high species density indicates that demand for edibles in exurban regions may be higher than space constraints allows. Our study better quantifies species biodiversity patterns in Beijing, and can inform urban planners about the value and usefulness of home garden space.

AB  - There is a relationship between cultivation of plants and mankind since the earliest human organizations. The use of plants in home gardens is a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation in certain localities. The aim of this research was to verify the occurrence of home gardens in different cities of three Brazilian states, besides knowing the use of cultivated plants for feed, medicinal and ornamental purposes. This study was carried out in cities of three Brazilian states Mato Grosso (Cuiaba and Caceres), Sergipe (Aracaju and Lagarto) and Parana (Curitiba and Campo Mourao) located in different regions of the country (Midwestern, Northeastern and Southern). Semi-structured interview were performed with residents of the state capital and countryside. Data were evaluated for popular knowledge regarding the use of plants and plant structure. Most interviewers have gardens with plants. Greater cultivation and use of food plants was observed by the interviewees, with the exception of Aracaju city. Residents in countryside had higher habit to cultivate plants when compared to people residing in the state capitals. Among the plant organs most cited the leaf stood out. Thus, it is concluded that there is a great practice of cultivating plants in the studied cities, however the use of plants varies from one region to another.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate the effect of farming technology on introducing medicinal plants (MP) and wild food plants (WFP) into a traditional agricultural system within pen-urban zones. Field investigations and semi-structured focus group interviews conducted in the Buhozi community showed that 27 health and nutrition problems dominated in the community, and could be treated with 86 domestic plant species. The selected domestic MP and WFP species were collected in the broad neighboring areas of the Buhozi site, and introduced to the experimental field of beans and maize crops in Buhozi. Among the 86 plants introduced, 37 species are confirmed as having both medicinal and nutritional properties, 47 species with medicinal, and 2 species with nutritional properties. The field is arranged in a way that living hedges made from Tithonia diversifolia provide bio-fertilizers to the plants growing along the hedges. The harvest of farming crops does not disturb the MP or WFP, and vice-versa. After harvesting the integrated plants, the community could gain about 40 times higher income, than from harvesting farming crops only. This kind of field may be used throughout the year, to provide both natural medicines and foods. It may therefore contribute to increasing small-scale crop producers' livelihood, while promoting biodiversity conservation. This model needs to be deeply documented, for further pharmaceutical and nutritional use.

AB  - Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world, yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas, and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolis, Minnesota, USA, in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the "natural-areas'' species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient, yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower-density regions, but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast, in comparison to species in natural areas, yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct They were more often short-lived, self-compatible, and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard flora's phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond, such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally, understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Gardens are ubiquitous in western cities, comprising up to a third of the total urban area and often containing a majority of the vegetation present. Gardens are the cumulative result of many individual plant choices, yet we know relatively little about the role of preference in these choices. We investigated peoples' preference for different garden plants and reasons for plant choices using a postal questionnaire (n = 224) containing 30 colour photos of garden plants and questions about gardening behaviour. Preferences were compared with the plants growing in the gardens of 48 randomly selected respondents. Objectively measured plant traits were used to relate preferences to the plants growing in people's gardens. Significant relationships were found between survey responses and both the traits and taxonomy of plants growing in respondent gardens. The results also show that people's preferences are very diverse, and that these preferences were related both to aesthetic traits such as flower size, leaf width and foliage colour, and non-visual traits such as nativeness and drought tolerance. Together these findings provide evidence that garden floras have responded to their social environment, and suggests that the very high levels of diversity observed in gardens can in part be attributed to the heterogeneity observed in this social environment.

AB  - Although urban domestic gardens hold great significance for biodiversity support in cities, these habitats have been relatively insufficiently studied, especially in developing country contexts. This paper assesses the composition, diversity, density and distribution of plant vegetation in urban domestic gardens in the rapidly expanding south Indian city of Bangalore. Overall species diversity is high, with 1,668 trees from 91 species, as well as 192 species of herbs and shrubs encountered from a total sample of 328 urban single domestic gardens and shared apartment gardens distributed across the city. The majority of species were uncommon, found in less than 5 % of all sampled locations. A high proportion of about 30 % of all species had uses as food or as spices, medicinal properties, and/or religious significance. In general, large shared apartment gardens and single domestic gardens had a greater number of trees with larger size, and greater tree and herb/shrub diversity compared to small shared apartment gardens and small to moderate sized single domestic gardens. Shared apartment gardens tended to harbor relatively distinct sets of species, especially trees, palms and plants with largely ornamental significance, while single domestic gardens contained a greater proportion of flowering and medicinal plants used in daily worship, as well as fruit bearing and spice bearing plants and trees. Residents observed a wide range of other animal and insect species in their gardens, but also indicated a decrease in wildlife biodiversity over time. The majority of residents observed some cultural practices associated with feeding of urban wildlife and insects including the provision of rice and water for birds, and of sugar for ants. The results of this research provide a comprehensive description of plant diversity and distribution in single domestic gardens and shared apartment gardens of different sizes, which can be very important for citizen groups, planners and administrators working towards urban planting and greening in the south Indian city of Bangalore. They also supplement the extremely limited information currently available on urban domestic gardens outside of cities in the west.

AB  - We evaluated the diversity of soil macrofauna communities inhabiting urban green spaces in Yancheng City, an urbanizing city located east of China. In the end of April 2011, the taxonomic richness, abundance and composition of soil macrofauna communities were assessed and compared among five types of green space (poplar forest, rapeseed farm, grassland in park, lawn and nursery garden) and three depth layers in the soil, with taxonomic resolution attained at the order level. Taxonomic richness (orders) and abundance were significantly different among green spaces. Diversity indices (Margalef's taxonomic richness R and Shannon-Weaver diversity index H') were higher in poplar forest, grassland in park and nursery garden than in rapeseed farm and lawn. Taxonomic richness (Chao 2) showed a similar trend. There were significant effects of green space type and soil layer, which showed a significant interaction affecting macrofauna composition. We recommend that urban green spaces can be used for maintaining biodiversity, not only for landscape purposes.

AB  - Domestic gardens can have both positive and negative effects on urban biodiversity conservation. We analyzed the flora of 1045 gardens in Bujumbura, Burundi. Among the 567 species identified in the gardens, 85% were not native. They originate mainly from tropical America (43%), tropical Asia (30%) or Africa (17%). Three plant assemblages were defined from a cluster analysis, corresponding to ornamental gardens, utilitarian gardens (plants used for fencing and food production), and mixed gardens (intermediate between the two former types). A Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis showed that the main floristic gradients in the garden vegetation were correlated to the socio-economical status of the neighborhood. High standing neighborhoods have higher proportion of ornamental gardens while most gardens in the popular and semi-rural neighborhoods are utilitarian. The species richness per garden was highest in high standing neighborhoods, mainly due to an area effect. When controlling for garden area, species richness is highest in the middle class neighborhoods. City gardens play an important role in the functioning of the urban ecosystem and provide shelter to native plant species and to the urban fauna. However, gardens also are sources of introduction of alien species. In Bujumbura, 9% of the alien garden species have already naturalized in the city, among which 14 invasive species. This number is expected to increase in the coming decennia as there are about 121 other garden species that present a high invasion risk they are invasive in other parts of the world in climates comparable to that of the Bujumbura region.

AB  - The large number of green space lawns in cities means that they shelter a high proportion of wild urban species, but the roles of landscape and management on the level of biodiversity in these spaces are little understood. We performed floristic inventories in 100 lawns in the southeast corner of Paris, France and linked their floristic diversity and composition to (1) the characteristics of urbanization given by the Land Use Pattern and the distance from the centre of Paris, (2) local factors including luminosity and size of the lawn and (3) the type of management, including pesticide and fertilizer use, animal and public access, and mowing frequency. A total of 79 species were identified, of which 9% were naturalized. Distribution of the species was largely conditioned by the management methods applied to the green spaces specific management strategies were associated with specific community traits and composition. As expected, the highest species richness and/or rarity were found in lawns submitted to private management, low use of pesticides and limited public access. But surprisingly high diversity was also sometimes found in small public lawns. The results establish relationships between human practices and characteristics of plant communities. We use them to make several recommendations on how best to optimize management of lawns with a view to conserving urban biodiversity.

AB  - The aim of this article is to identify the urban biodiversity in the residential landscapes and user preferences in Bartin urban area, located in the Western Black Sea Region, Turkey. The study was conducted in the residential gardens of the traditional urban fabric and the old urban pattern with conservation status at the national level (dwellings in the urban conservation area and registered buildings in the urban development area), and also in the new urban pattern (housing estates and detached houses). 120 residential gardens were selected and 140 plant species belonging to 57 families were identified. The plant species in the first 10 percent of 140 plants according to user preferences are considered in the statistical analyses. The results of the study indicate that the residential landscapes in the old and new urban pattern of Bartin have a considerable potential in terms of biodiversity. While fruit trees and natural plant species characterize the residential gardens in the old urban pattern, exotic plant species are common in the new urban pattern. The users prefer plants in their gardens for their functional use, rather than aesthetical use. It is further observed that the users in the old urban pattern use the plants as they grow, whereas the users in the new urban pattern use plants obtained from nursery gardens. Analyzing the urban biodiversity inventory in Bartin at the residential garden scale, this study concludes with some suggestions for sustainable urban development.

AB  - Urban landscapes support a high and rich diversity often occurring as unusual or unique communities. Urban green areas are a vital part of the urban landscape, providing contact with wildlife and environmental services with additional socio-ecological benefits to the overall quality of life. The composition and diversity of vascular plants and macromycetes were assessed in an urban green area of the city of Coimbra (central Portugal) comprising three landscape types (Oak-. Eucalyptus-, and Olive-stands), with historical periurban agriculture and forest uses. We recorded 287 taxa of plants, including three taxa with important ecological value (Quercus suber, Quercus faginea subsp. broteroi and Ruscus aculeatus) and 96 taxa of macromycetes. The pattern of land use resulted in the establishment of different plant and soil fungal communities' composition and diversity among these landscapes. The plant richness and diversity indices revealed similar trends within the landscape types, with the highest values found in the Olivestands due to the presence of herbaceous that decreased with tree cover density. Richness and diversity of macromycetes were higher in Oak-stands especially the symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities. Although not significant, higher saprobic fungi richness and diversity values were found in the Eucalyptus-stands. Given the undoubted ecological complexity of urban green areas and the value of these ecosystems for society in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to select bioindicators that are readily accessible and reliable to design balanced urban ecosystems by linking wildlife and biological parameters to human well-being.

AB  - This paper is a first attempt to describe the flora of domestic gardens from an urban environment in South Africa. A total of 835 plant species of 501 genera in 145 families was recorded from 100 gardens in a 54.9 km(2) area of the Tlokwe City Municipality [Potchefstroom], North-West Province. A substantial number of alien species (580) were recorded, but also many indigenous species (255) that included South African endemics (61) and protected species on the National Red Data List (18). A number of the alien species that were commonly cultivated are declared invasive plants in South Africa (88). Most of the cultivated indigenous taxa originated from the southeastern provinces of South Africa. This study provides new knowledge on the often overlooked biodiversity of urban areas in a developing, mega-diverse country. Most studies of a similar nature were conducted in the developed countries of Europe and are of limited use in the development of management plans of urban ecosystems in southern Africa.

AB  - (Species composition and plant use in old urban homegardens in Rio Clare, Southeast of Brazil). This study, based on the ethnobotanical approach, looked for to characterize the ancient urban home gardens in Rio Claro, municipality located in the Southeast of Brazil, carrying out a survey of the wealth of vegetal species and their uses, in 17 households selected randomly. The data had been collected by means of semistructured and structured interviews and by the gathering of plants. It was verified a total of 410 species, distributed in 97 botanical families, evidencing a high diversity of ligneous species, such as trees and shrubs (H' = 1,66 and J = 0.86). There were Surveyed 257 species for ornamental use, as well as 98 for alimentary and 93 for medicinal uses. Considering the great number of species found for the main categories of use, it can be inferred that the home gardens play important functions for the interviewed families, contributing for the food and medicine production destined for the consumption by the families themselves, and also playing an important esthetic function thanks to the variety of their ornamental plants. The wealth of these home gardens may be related to the rural origin and to the culture of the owners, who still keep a cultivation tradition. It was found that the products obtained from the home gardens contributed for the diet's variety of the informants, representing a promising potential for the improvement of the population alimentation.

AB  - Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) significantly contributes to food and nutritional security of urban dwellers in many African countries. Economic and demographic pressures often lead to transformation of subsistence-oriented traditional homegardens into commercial production units. Such transformation is claimed to result in decreasing plant diversity, particularly of local species. A study was therefore undertaken in 51 gardens of Niamey, Niger, to assess the factors determining plant diversity and the suitability of UPA for in situ conservation of plant genetic resources. In each garden, the number and abundance of all human-used plant species were determined, and species density, Shannon index and Shannon evenness were calculated. In the 51 surveyed gardens, a total of 116 plant species were cultivated, most of them for the production of fruits or vegetables. Annual vegetables dominated, particularly exotic species grown for sale. In the cold season, an average of 14 species were cultivated per garden, the Shannon index was 0.96 and evenness was 0.39. Commercial gardens had a species richness similar to that of subsistence gardens, but a lower evenness (P < 0.005), caused by the dominance of a few vegetable species. Gardens of immigrants had a lower Shannon index than those of members of the local Djerma ethnic group. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed significant influence of various variables on plant species richness and diversity parameters garden size (richness and Shannon index), ethnicity of the gardener (richness and evenness), gender of the gardener and cash-oriented production (evenness), household size (richness) and garden possession status (Shannon index). Cluster analysis revealed the existence of five garden types. The highest species richness and diversity, particularly of perennial and local species, was found in large, peri-urban, commercial gardens managed by relatively wealthy, elderly gardeners with large families and a regular non-agricultural income.

T2  - Journal of Vegetation Science
AB  - Question What floras are typically associated with domestic gardens in cities? Location The urban areas of the cities of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leicester and Oxford, UK. Methods The composition and diversity of plant species in 267 urban domestic gardens in the five cities was recorded by complete census and quadrat sampling. Results The entire garden flora consisted of 1056 species, of which 30% were native and 70% alien. 34% of the 50 most frequently recorded species in gardens were native, a number of them being weeds. Although plant species richness in individual gardens varied with garden area, the above breakdowns held true when the cities were considered individually. The only exception was Belfast where, overall, plant species richness was slightly lower than in any of the other cities. Comparing quadrat samples, species richness was found to be greater in the garden habitats of each of the cities than in a number of other habitats, with species accumulation curves showing no sign of reaching saturation at 120 quadrats. This is due to the high proportion of alien species found in gardens, and in particular those surviving at low densities as a result of human intervention. Conclusion There was surprisingly little difference in plant species richness, diversity or composition between the cities, despite the variation in geographical and climatic factors. This suggests that human factors such as plant availability, garden management and social/economic status of individual householders had an overriding influence.

T2  - Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science
AB  - Ecological soil functions are protected in Germany. Thus, for the sustainable use of urban soil resources data on the function of soils to serve as a habitat are required. Soil microbial biomass and activities were studied in two surface horizons in two consecutive years at nine sites in Stuttgart, Germany, differing in land use. Microbial biomass (chloroform-fumigation extraction, substrate-induced respiration) and microbial activities (potential N mineralization, potential ammonium oxidation, and enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, urease, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase) were determined in 2001 and 2002. DIN/ISO standard methods were applied as far as they were available. Furthermore, soil chemical properties were determined in the 2001-samples. Large differences in chemical and microbiological properties among surface horizons were found. Concentrations of microbial biomass and microbial activities were, however, often comparable to agricultural or forest surface soils. The lowest microbial biomass and activities were observed at a highly disturbed railway area where vegetation was missing and total organic C (TOC) had been altered by anthropogenic organic particles. In contrast, microorganisms were promoted at vegetated sites and where organic impurities were negligible. As TOC was altered by obscure organic matter, total N (TN) and not TOC closely correlated with soil microbiological properties. Biomass and activity generally decreased with depth, but mixing of organic matter resulted in more uniform depth distribution of microbial properties in one garden soil. In 2002, microbial biomass and activity were often lower compared to 2001, but interpretation of this difference hampered as the number of samples taken was probably not sufficient to address the spatial variability in soil properties. Additional studies are needed to develop simple and cost-effective procedures for the evaluation of ecological quality of urban soils by combined efforts of city planners and soil scientists.

AU  - Head, L

T2  - Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers
AB  - Despite an academic shift from dualistic to hybrid frameworks of culture/nature relations, separationist paradigms of environmental management have great resilience and vernacular appeal. The conditions under which they are reinforced, maintained or ruptured need more detailed attention because of the urgent environmental challenges of a humanly transformed earth. We draw on research in 265 Australian backyard gardens, focusing on two themes where conceptual and material bounding practices intertwine; spatial boundary-making and native plants. We trace the resilience of separationist approaches in the Australian context to the overlay of indigeneity/ non-indigeneity atop other dualisms, and their rupture to situations of close everyday engagement between people, plants, water and birds. Our ethnographic methods show that gardens are places where both attitudes and practices can change in the process of such engagements. In a world where questions of sustainability are increasingly driven by cities and their residents, these chains of agency help identify areas of hope and transformative potential as well as concern.

T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - Relatively little attention has been devoted to the urban ecology of bats (Chiroptera) despite their ecological importance. Although previous studies,have indicated that urbanization has a negative effect on the abundance of bats and bat activity, this relationship may differ among regions. We monitored bat activity during 1997-1999 in 1520 natural areas distributed across a 3500-km(2) area spanning the Chicago metropolitan area in northeastern Illinois. Our objectives were to elucidate relationships between landscape and microhabitat characteristics and bat activity. Bat activity was correlated with visual estimates of abundance. Among adjacent land-use classes, industrial/commercial use was positively related,to bat activity in 1997 and 1999, and the predominant rural land use, agriculture, was negatively associated with bat activity in 1998. Proportion of woodland habitat within study areas was positively related to bat activity in every year. There was a positive relationship between agricultural land use and relative use of water sites in each year. Microhabitat analyses revealed that distance between trees was positively related to. bat activity in woodlands, and-in open habitats there was a relatively strong, negative relationship between distance from the edge and bat activity. Within open habitats, mowed areas had more bat activity than agricultural areas. Our landscape results suggest that the relationship between urbanization and bats may be related to context. Heterogeneous urban landscapes may represent islands,of habitat for some bats within larger landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture, such as much of the Midwest.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species richness, composition, spore density and diversity indices were evaluated in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA at 20 sampling sites selected to represent the four predominant land-use types found in the greater urban area urban-residential, urban non-residential, agriculture and desert. AMF spores were extracted and identified from soil samples and from trap cultures established using soil collected at each site. Data were analyzed according to land use, land-use history, soil chemistry and vegetation characteristics at each site. Current agricultural sites were associated with decreased spore densities and historically agricultural sites with decreased species richness. Overall species composition was similar to that previously reported for the Sonoran desert, but composition at each sampling site was influenced by the vegetation from which samples were collected. Sites with the highest degrees of similarity in AMF species composition were also similar to each other in native plants or land use. Conversely, sites with the lowest similarity in AMF composition were those from which the majority of samples were collected from non-mycorrhizal plants, predominately ectomycorrhizal plants or bare soil. Spores of Glomus microggregatum were most abundant in urban sites, while those of G. eburneum were most abundant in desert and agricultural sites. Further studies are needed to determine the functional implications of shifts in AMF communities in urban ecosystems, including effects on plant primary productivity.

AB  - Since the end of the Vietnam War, thousands of Laotian Hmong have immigrated to the United States, many ultimately resettling in the Central Valley of California. In the inner-city environment of Sacramento, the Hmong continue their agrarian traditions by creating urban gardens where they grow traditional plants. In this study, we document 59 Hmong garden species grown at a site in South Sacramento. Most of these species are documented in the Southeast Asian botanical literature as either food or medicinal plants. Uses of the plants are discussed as is the importance of urban gardens in maintaining Hmong cultural identity and practices.

AB  - The aim of our study was to assess the seasonal and overnight changes in the flight activity and habitat use of four bat species under the conditions of a sub-mountain town by a detector monitoring. The urban habitats visited from May until] October 1998 - 2000 were divided into three categories gardens (illuminated or non-illuminated gardens and larger groups of trees), urban habitat (old and new buildings in suburbs and downtown), and water (streams and ponds). Only for Myotis daubentonii was a statistically significant increase in flight activity recorded between the lactation and post-lactation periods. The highest activity of M. daubentonii was recorded in the vicinity of water bodies. The activities of Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Nyctalus noctula were similar in relation to the habitats. Only in Eptesicus serotinus was the activity recorded per habitat type not significantly different. The changes of activity of P. pipistrellus had a bimodal character with the first peak in the 5th and the 6th ten-minutes and the second in the 12th ten-minutes. In N. noctula, activity was characterized by commuting over the urban habitats during the first 0.5 h. Relatively high activity was recorded in E. serotinus during the first 0.5 h in gardens.

AB  - Despite being fragmented and highly disturbed habitats, urban turfgrass ecosystems harbor a surprising diversity of arthropods. The suitability of turf as arthropod habitat, however, likely depends on the extent and types of pesticides and fertilizers used. For example, moderate levels of weedcover in low-input lawnsmayprovide alternative food resources.Weconducted a 2-yr Þeld study to: 1) characterize the ground beetle (Carabidae) species assemblage in turfgrass, and 2) assess the direct and indirect effects of lawn management on carabid communities. Weed cover and beetle activity were compared among four lawn management programs: 1) consumer/garden center, 2) integrated pest management (IPM), 3) natural organic, and 4) no-input control. Nearly 5,000 carabid beetles across 17 species were collected with the predator Cyclotrachelus sodalis LeConte numerically dominating the trap catch (87% and 45% of individuals in 2005 and 2006, respectively). Populations of C. sodalis underwent a distinct peak in activity during the third week of June, whereas omnivorous and granivorous species tended to occur at far lower levels and were less variable over the season. We found no evidence for direct effects of lawn management on carabid species diversity; however, we detected an indirect effect mediated by variation in weed cover. Seed-feeding species were positively correlated with turf weeds early in 2006, whereas strictly predaceous species were not. Thus, turf management programs that lead to changes in plant species composition (i.e., herbicide regimes) may indirectly shape epigeal arthropod communities more strongly than the direct effects of insecticide use.

AB  - Information on the urban flora and vegetation in the industrial new cities in Egypt are insufficient and far from complete. For this reason, this study was undertaken as the first attempt to fill this gap of knowledge. For two successive years (2004 and 2005), a reconnaissance survey was conducted in four new industrial cities: 6th October, El-Sadat, Burg El-Arab and 10th Ramadan; aiming at: (1) recognizing the floristic composition and vegetation structure of each of the studied cities; (2) identifying the main urban habitats dominating the studied cities; (3) comparing the vegetation of the urban habitats at the boundaries of each city, where desert soil merges gradually with the agricultural land, with that at its centre (purely agricultural land); and (4) analyzing, quantitatively, the vegetation groups (plant communities) that characterize the urban habitats. A total of 189 permanent stands in the four cities were selected to represent the apparent variation in the different habitats. These stands were distributed as follows: 49 in 6th October, 37 in El-Sadat, 45 in Burg El-Arab, and 58 in 10th Ramadan. Altogether, 305 species of the vascular plants constituted the main synanthropic flora and the total number of species varied from 171 in Burg El-Arab, 157 in 10th Ramadan, 144 in Sadat and 132 to 6th October. The largest families that formed the main bulk of the recorded flora were Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae, followed by Euphorbiaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Cruciferae, Cyperaceae, Umbelliferae and Solanaceae. Five main urban habitats (from inner city toward outskirts) were distinguished: lawns, home gardens, public gardens, waste lands and desert outskirts. The most species-rich habitat was the waste lands (172 species), while the total number of species varied from 104 in the lawns and 113 home gardens, to 123 in the desert and 133 in the public gardens. Generally, the recorded synanthropic flora within the five main urban habitats can be classified into: (1) cultivated plant species that included ornamentals, hedges, shade plants, fodder plants, vegetables and fruits; (2) canal banks, salinized areas and wetland plants; (3) xerophytic plants of the outskirting desert; and (4) weeds of arable lands. Application of multivariate analyses techniques to 4 floristic data matrices yielded 22 TWINSPAN vegetation groups in the cities, and 26 in the five habitats, clearly separated along the first two axes of DCA.

AB  - The residential vegetation features in urban landscapes play an important role as indicators regarding urban biodiversity potential and cultural changing. They also include ornamental resources in the context to landscape appreciation for human environment. Therefore, this paper provides quantitative information on the distribution of plant species in urban residential landscape areas of Trabzon city (Turkey). In a total of 218 sampled areas, 274 plants species belonging to 70 families were surveyed with respect to residential use types of the city. The study results showed that among the species recorded in five residential type (traditional housing, detached housing, villa, apartment blocks and sites, mass housing for employees), non-native taxa frequency of a total species are much and dominantly represent residential landscape structure. Additionally, the species richness and diversity is positively related to new urban development areas. But, it was clearly determined that the vegetation structure has tended to ornamental purposes different from traditional residential gardens including fruit and other benefiting species. Consequently, it can be evidence that the residential vegetation is ornamental plant resources to urban biodiversity and that the distribution of the species in urban landscapes follows necessities of city and human quality.

AB  - Invasive species are often favoured in fragmented, highly-modified, human-dominated landscapes such as urban areas. Because successful invasive urban adapters can occupy habitat that is quite different from that in their original range, effective management programmes for invasive species in urban areas require an understanding of distribution, habitat and resource requirements at a local scale that is tailored to the fine-scale heterogeneity typical of urban landscapes. The common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is one of New Zealand’s most destructive invasive pest species. As brushtail possums traditionally occupy forest habitat, control in New Zealand has focussed on rural and forest habitats, and forest fragments in cities. However, as successful urban adapters, possums may be occupying a wider range of habitats. Here we use site occupancy methods to determine the distribution of brushtail possums across five distinguishable urban habitat types during summer, which is when possums have the greatest impacts on breeding birds. We collected data on possum presence/absence and habitat characteristics, including possible sources of supplementary food (fruit trees, vegetable gardens, compost heaps), and the availability of forest fragments from 150 survey locations. Predictive distribution models constructed using the programme PRESENCE revealed that while occupancy rates were highest in forest fragments, possums were still present across a large proportion of residential habitat with occupancy decreasing as housing density increased and green cover decreased. The presence of supplementary food sources was important in predicting possum occupancy, which may reflect the high nutritional value of these food types. Additionally, occupancy decreased as the proportion of forest fragment decreased, indicating the importance of forest fragments in determining possum distribution. Control operations to protect native birds from possum predation in cities should include well-vegetated residential areas; these modified habitats not only support possums but provide a source for reinvasion of fragments.

AB  - Domestic gardens are the major contributor to greening the spatial plan in some compact cities. Irbid, Jordan is a densely populated city that has limited and deteriorating natural vegetation and is located in an arid to semi-arid climate. We investigated the density of domestic gardens (proportion of gardened residential units) in Irbid city and explored some properties of domestic gardens. The research focused on the city domestic garden types, their distribution, gardens proportions and association to household economic status and parcel area. Four hundred and thirty residential units were selected randomly using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The sample size for each district was identified proportionally relative to the district’s total residential units. Parcel area, district population, household income and landscape properties information were obtained from GIS maps, homeowners’ interviews or on site observations. Sixty-two percent of the city residential units had gardens and those gardens were distributed unequally (21–100%) among city districts. Rural areas had higher garden densities (proportions) compared to that at the city center. Around 50% of the city gardens were utilitarian and were concentrated in the rural areas, while the aesthetically designed gardens represented 21% of the total gardens and were significantly concentrated near the core urban area of the city. Around 53% of the city domestic gardens were categorized as side yards. The districts’ domestic garden proportions and parcel sizes were positively correlated. The proportions of aesthetic gardens were positively correlated with districts’ median income while utilitarian garden proportions strongly and inversely correlated with districts income. This knowledge about the proportions of domestic gardens distribution, trends, garden attributes and other factors that interfere with the existence and shape of domestic gardens has implications for species composition and can serve as a basis for green infrastructure planning, sustainable environmental planning strategies, and land use policies.

AB  - Using data from selected areas in five UK cities, we studied the relationships between urban form and the following measures of ecosystem performance availability and patch characteristics of tree cover, gardens and green space; storm-water run-off; maximum temperature; carbon sequestration. Although most measures of ecosystem performance declined with increasing urban density, there was considerable variability in the relationships. This suggests that at any given density, there is substantial scope for maximising ecological performance. The social status of residents was related to measures of tree cover. Housing type was significantly associated with some types of ecosystem service provision, indicating that the type of development may be important independent of its density. These findings have implications for understanding the distribution of ecosystem services and biodiversity across urban landscapes, and the management of development aimed at meeting UK government housing density targets.

T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - Private gardens collectively comprise the largest green space in most cities and the greatest potential for increasing the extent of wildlife-friendly and native-dominated habitat, improving the quality of ecosystem services, and providing opportunities for urban dwellers to reconnect with nature. Because attitudes and values driving landscape preferences in gardens are complex and often not conducive to biodiversity, and a gap exists between the possession of knowledge or values and the expression of pro-environmental behavior, facilitating change in gardening behavior is challenging. We attempted to improve knowledge and influence values, attitudes, and gardening behavior of 55 householders in favor of native biodiversity and environmentally friendly practices, through a two-way communication process, or interactive dialog, during a process of biodiversity documentation of their gardens. Informative feedback on their garden with a normative component was also provided. Despite being well educated and knowledgeable about common species at the start of the study, an increase in knowledge and shift in attitude was detected in 64% of householders 40% reported a greater understanding of wildlife, and 26% made changes in their gardens, 13% to support native biodiversity. The normative component of our feedback information was of particular interest to 20% of householders. Because neighborhood norms influence gardening practices, changes adopted by a proportion of householders should be perpetuated across neighborhoods. The process of biodiversity assessment, dialog, and feedback was effective in improving knowledge of wildlife and native species, and stimulated a shift in attitude that resulted in native-friendly gardening practices. These changes were detected primarily through open self-report questions, rather than quantitative measures.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - As the pace of urbanization accelerates, the conservation of urban biodiversity emerges as a rising concern. Urban ecological research has revealed that some green areas in cities can harbor a rich diversity of species that can be enhanced by certain landscape- and local-scale structural planning variables. However, while most studies have been conducted in large greenspaces (e.g., parks, remnants), less effort was made to understand which variables influence biodiversity within small green patches and the efficiency of management practices has been seldom investigated. Here, we explore how management practices interplayed with landscape and structural variables to influence the diversity of plants, birds, butterflies and other pollinating insects in small public gardens (0.5-2.0 ha) in the center of a large metropolis (Paris, France). Small public gardens hosted significant common biodiversity and the ones that employed a conservation program (i.e., differential management) supported a higher diversity of all taxa and less urbanophile communities of birds and butterflies. Local-scale and management variables were more important in enhancing biodiversity than landscape-scale variables. Specifically, lawns rich in wild plants attracted many pollinators and bird richness increased with tree cover. Pesticides had a negative effect on bird richness, while a higher diversity of habitats and soils (i.e. mulching, peat) increased the diversity of all four taxa. We also found that bird richness could serve as a reasonable surrogate for butterflies and other pollinators. Our results highlight how planning and managing public gardens in the center of a large metropolis can benefit biodiversity, regardless of spatial context.

T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Urban ecology is emerging as an integrative science that explores the interactions of people and biodiversity in cities. Interdisciplinary research requires the creation of new tools that allow the investigation of relations between people and biodiversity. It has been established that access to green spaces or nature benefits city dwellers, but the role of species diversity in providing psychological benefits remains poorly studied. We developed a user‐friendly 3‐dimensional computer program (Virtual Garden [www.tinyurl.com/3DVirtualGarden]) that allows people to design their own public or private green spaces with 95 biotic and abiotic features. Virtual Garden allows researchers to explore what elements of biodiversity people would like to have in their nearby green spaces while accounting for other functions that people value in urban green spaces. In 2011, 732 participants used our Virtual Garden program to design their ideal small public garden. On average gardens contained 5 different animals, 8 flowers, and 5 woody plant species. Although the mathematical distribution of flower and woody plant richness (i.e., number of species per garden) appeared to be similar to what would be expected by random selection of features, 30% of participants did not place any animal species in their gardens. Among those who placed animals in their gardens, 94% selected colorful species (e.g., ladybug [Coccinella septempunctata], Great Tit [Parus major], and goldfish), 53% selected herptiles or large mammals, and 67% selected non‐native species. Older participants with a higher level of education and participants with a greater concern for nature designed gardens with relatively higher species richness and more native species. If cities are to be planned for the mutual benefit of people and biodiversity and to provide people meaningful experiences with urban nature, it is important to investigate people's relations with biodiversity further. Virtual Garden offers a standardized tool with which to explore these relations in different environments, cultures, and countries. It can also be used by stakeholders (e.g., city planners) to consider people's opinions of local design.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Urbanization is presenting a growing problem for biodiversity conservation, notably by increasingly isolating over half of the world's population from the experience of nature. This separation of people from nature is an important environmental issue, as it could fundamentally influence the way people value nature and their willingness to conserve it. Here we provide the first experimental study that jointly explores how urban biodiversity can be enhanced and how these changes may influence some aspects of people-biodiversity interactions. We significantly increased the diversity of flowers, birds and pollinators in small public gardens (Paris, France) by providing additional resources (i.e., planting flower-meadows and placing nesting-boxes). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in situ with 1116 regular garden users before and after the manipulation. Close-ended questionnaires were completed exploring the respondents' biodiversity perception and their sensitivity to the changes in biodiversity. Our results highlight a people-biodiversity paradox between people's perceptions and biodiversity awareness. Respondents expressed a strong preference for a rich diversity of species (excluding insects) and related this diversity to their well-being in the gardens. However, they did not notice the diversity of species. Respondents underestimated species richness and only noticed the changes in native flower richness in those gardens where advertisement and public involvement were organized. More experimental interdisciplinary studies are needed to further explore the people-biodiversity interactions. This would help expose the role that urban biodiversity plays in people's daily life and the importance of this interaction for raising public support for general conservation policies.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - The National Wildlife Federation's (NWF) Certified Wildlife Habitat (TM) program strives to provide habitat for wildlife, primarily in human-dominated landscapes. The main objective of our research project was to determine if yards certified in the NWF's program offered wildlife habitat not available in non-certified yards in the same neighborhood. A second objective was to validate the applications of certified landowners by examining habitat listed on their certification application relative to what was available in their yard. Our project focused on neighborhoods within the greater Orlando, Florida metropolitan area. We visited 50 certified yards, 50 neighboring, non-certified yards, and 50 non-adjacent, non-certified yards in the same neighborhood. To evaluate the yards, we used an ecological check-list to determine the quality and quantity of wildlife habitat in each yard. Based on the results of our study, there were significant differences in both quality and quantity of habitat found in certified versus non-certified yards. The Certified Wildlife Habitat (TM) program is successful in that yards in the NWF program offer wildlife habitat that is not available in non-certified yards. However, our biggest recommendation for the NWF program is that it needs to have a larger, more contiguous landscape scope. Certified yards need to be adjacent, or in close enough proximity to one another that they can act as a contiguous landscape in and of themselves, but also have connection to and coordination with other larger blocks of habitat.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - In a rapidly urbanizing world, people are increasingly at risk of being disconnected from nature. Previous studies demonstrate that urban parks support contact of urban dwellers with "nature", urban foraging activities and contribute to human well-being. While the importance of biodiversity underlying ecosystem services is broadly acknowledged, the role of individual plant species in the interaction of park visitors with biodiversity has received less attention. By applying a mixed methods approach in two parks in Berlin (biodiversity analysis, observation, interviews), we aimed to (i) determine the importance of biodiversity interactionat the species level in relation to other park activities, (ii) identify the range of used and non-used plant species, (iii) determine purposes underlying the utilization of individual species, and (iv) analyze gender-related differences in these activities. Results indicated a considerable proportion of activities related to individual plant species (12%), compared to other activities in parks. In total, 26 cultivated or spontaneous species (ca 17% of the local species pools), were used for consumption (60%), decoration (21%) and biodiversity experience (17%). Native and non-native plants were utilized proportionally to local supply. More women (78%) than men interacted with plant species. Another 33 species were identified as being gathered in Berlin outside of gardens based on interviews of park visitors. Findings support approaches toward a biodiversity-friendly park design and management. Maintaining and facilitating biodiversity interactions for a broad range of park-users is a promising pathway to biodiversity conservation in cities and would help counteract the loss of experience in human-nature interactions.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - In sprawling metropolitan areas, residential landscaping is a major concern with respect to biodiversity conservation, and it could play a critical role in conserving wildlife habitat. In the United States, residential landscaping typically consists of maintained lawns with specimen plantings of non-native trees and shrubs; such designs provide poor habitat for urban wildlife species. We conducted a case study of Raleigh, North Carolina residents to determine how providing information about the benefits of native plant landscaping to bird species influenced urban residents' landscaping preferences. We used Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests to determine if respondent preferences for 0, 50, 75 and 100 % native plant landscaping coverages changed after residents were informed about the benefits that native plants provide for birds. Initially, the 50 % native landscaping coverage was most preferred by residents; however, preferences for all four native plant landscaping coverage designs were significantly different after the informational treatment. Neutrality changed to opposition for the 0 % native plant coverage, while opposition changed to support and neutrality for the 75 and 100 % native plant coverage designs, respectively. After the informational treatment, the 50 and 75 % native plant landscaping coverage had the highest mean preference levels, although the 100 % design was ranked first more than any other design. Our findings suggest that residential support for native plant landscaping is higher than is reflected by typical residential landscaping practices, and that dissemination of information regarding the benefits of native plant landscaping to birds could alter public preferences for native plant landscaping.

AB  - Complementary public and private conservation action is required to sustain native biodiversity in cities. Residents can contribute by wildlife gardening - removing environmental weeds, cultivating indigenous flora, and improving habitat in their gardens. There is currently little guidance about how best to involve residents in wildlife gardening and align their work with public land management. We explored how a purposively chosen wildlife gardening program in Melbourne, Australia engaged and supported residents to augment local government efforts to conserve indigenous biota. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with program members to understand the program's impact on their gardening and their connections with their council and community. Unpublished Council survey data were used to position interview findings on wildlife gardening activities and the value of program features. Interviewees detailed how they modified their gardening to assist their council to conserve indigenous biota. Five program features were implicated in this change (1) on-site garden assessment; (2) indigenous community nursery; (3) communication hubs; (4) a framework that fosters experiential learning and community linkages; and (5) endorsement of each garden's potential conservation contribution. Collaborative wildlife gardening programs can engage residents to manage their land to achieve landscape-focused conservation goals while building relationships with council and community.

AB  - This study examines individual commitment to biodiversity during adulthood. We studied the interrelations between everyday experiences of nature, knowledge about biodiversity, connectedness with nature, and implementation of specific pro-biodiversity practices, through a survey covering 473 adults in Paris surroundings (France). More specifically, we showed that people involved in experiences of nature in which attentiveness to biodiversity is explicit (citizen science, nature watch association, environmental association) have more knowledge about biodiversity and conservation than both people involved in experiences of nature in which attention to biodiversity remains implicit (community garden, allotment, community-supported agriculture), and people without such kinds of experience of nature. However, we found that people experiencing nature as part of a daily routine, whatever the type of experience, were more connected to nature and more likely to implement active pro-biodiversity practices. With this interdisciplinary study that links conservation biology and conservation psychology, we help understand more precisely the levels of commitment of urban and sub-urban adults toward biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Despite growing evidence pointing to the multiple benefits of home gardening, few studies have considered the health and well-being benefits perceived by gardeners who are principally motivated by biodiversity conservation (i.e. home gardening for biodiversity conservation). This study explores the environmental, social and economic co-benefits (and costs) of home gardening for biodiversity conservation in the City of Winnipeg, Canada. A total of 42 semi-structured interviews (30-60min each) were conducted with 50 home gardeners who were formally certified or locally recognised for undertaking multiple gardening activities that promote biodiversity conservation. Thematic analysis revealed that study participants self-reported a range of environmental, psychological, physiological and social outcomes associated with their home gardening experiences. Despite home gardening often being a solitary activity, most gardeners valued the multiple forms of social interaction that occurred during important social events in their garden, or when connecting with passers-by. Home gardeners also cited benefits related to connection to nature and place attachment; attention restoration; reduced stress and anxiety; improved mood; satisfaction and pride; increased self-esteem and courage to do things differently in life; and, important education or learning opportunities. However, conflicts relating to the nexus between biodiversity and perceived tidiness of gardens emerged, which raise important ethical and social justice issues for sustainability planning. We compare key insights to the benefits (and costs) of community gardening and make some recommendations for future research, including how to engage more disadvantaged groups in gardening for conservation.

AB  - The paper presents a method that addresses the problem of the amount of green space required for the environment areas of lower biodiversity by the ecological element threshold method. The original habitat had been highly disturbed by human activities in most developing countries. Taking the population carrying capacity, the balance of carbon-oxygen, and the supply-demand equilibrium of water resource as a group of conjugate restriction factors of green space planning, it quantifies the total amount of green space required to keep the ecological system in balance for the town of Shaliuhe, Hebei Province as the case study. The results show that the main restrictive factor at Shaliuhe town is the imbalance between the supply and demand for the water resource, 89.34% of which is used in agriculture. Therefore, the effects of various ecological improvements are calculated for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015. This case study could be used as a model for the planning of other towns on the northeast China plain to improve the environment, ecology and sustainability. Similarly, the Chinese scenario might provide a useable reference to other developing countries.

T2  - Landscape Ecology
AB  - The role of humans in the restoration of ecosystems has been emphasised since its inception. The human dimension of restoration is particularly well established in urban ecosystems because this is where people and nature co-exist. At the same time, the altered biophysical conditions that characterise cities place constraints on restoration in its strictest sense-assisting the recovery of historic ecosystems. Rather than viewing this as a shortcoming, in this paper, we discuss the ways in which such constraints can be viewed as opportunities. There is the chance to broaden traditional conservation and restoration goals for urban settings reflecting peoples' preferences for nature in their backyards, and in doing so, offer people multiple ways in which to engage with nature. In this paper, we consider four main restoration options-conserve and restore nature at the fringes, restore remnant patches of urban nature, manage novel ecosystems and garden with iconic species-in terms of their potential to contribute to promoting human-nature interactions in urban landscapes. We explore how these options are affected by environmental, economic, social and cultural factors, drawing on examples from cities around the world. Ecological restoration can contribute to the sustainability of urban landscapes, not just in terms of nature conservation, but also by providing opportunities for people to interact with nature and so increase our understanding of how people perceive and value landscapes.

AB  - As an important approach to the realization of agricultural sustainable development, multifunctionality has become a hot spot in the field of urban agriculture. Taking 13 agricultural counties of Beijing City as the assessing units, this study selects 10 assessing index from ecological, economic and social aspects, determines the index weight using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and establishes an index system for the integrated agricultural function. Based on standardized data from agricultural census and remote sensing, the integrated function and multifunctionality of urban agriculture in Beijing City are assessed through the index grade mapping. The results show that agricultural counties with the highest score in ecological, economic, and social function are Yanqing, Changping, and Miyun, respectively; and the greatest disparity among those counties is economic function, followed by social and ecological function. Topography and human disturbance may be the factors that affect integrated agricultural function. The integrated agricultural function of Beijing rises at the beginning then drops later with the increase of mean slope, average altitude, and distance from the city. The whole city behaves balance among ecological, economic, and social functions at the macro level, with 8 out of the 13 counties belonging to ecology-society-economy balanced areas, while no county is dominant in only one of the three functions. On the micro scale, however, different counties have their own functional inclination Miyun, Yanqing, Mentougou, and Fengtai are ecology-society dominant, and Tongzhou is ecology-economy dominant. The agricultural multifunctionality in Beijing City declines from the north to the south, with Pinggu having the most significant agricultural multifunctionality. The results match up well with the objective condition of Beijing's urban agriculture planning, which has proved the methodological rationality of the assessment to a certain extent.

AB  - Urban sustainability discourse promotes the increased use of green infrastructure (GI) because of its contribution of important ecosystem services to city dwellers. Under this vision, all urban green spaces, including those at the household scale, are valued for their potential contributions to a city's social-ecological functioning and associated benefits for human well-being. Understanding how urban residential green spaces have evolved can help improve sustainable urban planning and design, but it requires examining urban processes occurring at multiple scales. The interaction between social structures and ecological structures within the subtropical city of San Juan, the capital and the largest city of Puerto Rico, has been an important focus of study of the San Juan ULTRA (Urban Long-Term Research Area) network, advancing understanding of the city's vulnerabilities and potential adaptive capacity. Here we provide a synthesis of several social-ecological processes driving residential yard dynamics in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, through the evaluation of empirical findings related to yard management decisions, yard area, and yard services. We emphasize the role of factors occurring at the household scale. Results are discussed within the context of shrinking cities using an integrated, multi-scalar, social-ecological systems framework, and consider the implications of household green infrastructure for advancing urban sustainability theory.

T2  - Bird Study
AB  - A survey of the occurence of birds in gardens in 14 countries in western Europe was conducted between 23 October 1988 and 20 May 1989. Most of the 440 participating gardens were on the edge of towns and 40% had trees, grass and shrubs. Their average size as 1608 m2. One hundred and seventy-six species of birds were recorded in all, with a mean of 21 per garden. Garden size was the most important factor determining the number of species present; gardens with both deciduous and coniferous trees had comparatively many species, urban gardens had comparatively few. The frequency with which artificial food was provided had little effect on the number of species recorded in a garden. The frequency of provision differed between countries but was uniformly greater in winter than in spring. Although there were substantial regional differences, the broad suite of species entering gardens was similar throughout Europe, the commonest species being Great Tit, Blackbird, Blue Tit, House Sparrow, Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Robin and Magpie. The occurrence of many species in gardens varied seasonally, particularly in relation to migration patterns.

AB  - An experiment, involving 2000 members of the public, determined the identity of nest predators in urban environments. Experimental nests of halved tennis balls covered with coconut fibre and wool were manufactured to resemble the nests of willie wagtails, Rhipidura leucophrys. The identity of predators was determined by analysis of imprints left in artificial eggs made of coloured modelling clay. Sixty-four per cent of nests were preyed upon, with most predation being the result of large birds. Direct observations of predation (n = 134) indicated that pied currawongs were the most common large bird, accounting for 52% of all predation. Predation incidence was higher in gardens with more trees and in which kookaburras, Dacelo novaeguineae, were fed frequently Among nests placed in trees, nest predation was correlated with nest height. Eggs camouflaged by speckling experienced a similar incidence of predation to plain eggs. This study provides evidence to support the contention that pied currawongs are a major threat to the persistence of small birds in Australian urban environments.

AB  - An urban population of Common Blackbirds Turdus merula was studied between 1995 and 1998 in the Botanic Garden in Bonn, Germany. The number of breeding pairs varied from 32 to 39 per breeding season. Mean divorce rate (pair separation with remating of at least one of the partners) between two breeding seasons was 19.3% and 5.1% within breeding seasons. The number of fledglings produced per breeding season, of pairs which subsequently divorced, was significantly lower than that of pairs that stayed together. Females, but not males, produced more fledglings in the season after divorce than with their former mates the year before, and as many as females of the same age in stable pair bonds. The increase in reproductive success was thus unlikely to be due to age effects. Nestling mass correlated positively with offspring survival to the following year. Females had heavier nestlings after divorce than in their former pair bond. There was no difference in nestling mass for males before and after divorce. The data were used to test the predictions of several hypotheses to explain divorce. Because divorce was more likely after low reproductive success in the previous year, and only females benefited, the findings best support the 'better option' hypothesis.

AB  - A large database collated by bird watchers was analysed to determine whether birds living in the urban habitats of Sydney, Australia could be characterised as a discrete community differing from those occupying a variety of nearby native habitats. Standardised surveys at fixed distances from nine remnants of one native habitat (woodland/scrub on Hawkesbury sandstone) were then conducted to determine whether size of, and distance to, remnants of native habitat influenced the composition of the surrounding suburban bird community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling did not separate the bird community of urban parks and gardens from those occupying residential areas. However, analysis of similarity showed that these communities were significantly different from the bird communities of each of the native habitats. Suburban habitats could be differentiated by the prevalence of exotic species as well as parrots, large honeyeaters, and large birds incorporating vertebrate foods in their diet, and a relative rarity of small insectivores and honeyeaters. Nearby remnant vegetation had little effect on the bird community inhabiting suburban areas. No significant effects of remnant size or remnant proximity were detected for species richness, individual abundance or community composition. These results suggest that there is little overlap in use of urban and remnant habitats by the majority of species and that in order to increase bird diversity, urban habitats must provide a fuller complement of ecological requirements.

T2  - Ibis
AB  - House Sparrow Passer domesticus populations have declined throughout Europe over the last two to three decades; this is of particular concern in urban areas. We analysed data from extensive census schemes organized by the British Trust for Ornithology to determine the current population size of the House Sparrow in Britain, and to assess long-term patterns of change, both in the wider countryside and in urban environments. The national breeding population of House Sparrows was estimated at approximately 13 million individuals (95% confidence interval, 11.9-14.8 million), or about six million pairs. Most of these occur in southeast England and densities are greatest in suburban and rural garden habitats. Overall, populations in rural areas have declined by 47% since the mid 1970s, whereas those in urban and suburban areas have declined by about 60%. Changes in farming practices are likely to account for at least some of the decline in the wider countryside, probably related to changes in food resources, with a loss of grain in fields and more secure storage of harvested grain, though these changes are unquantified. In urban areas, there was an earlier period of decline in the first half of the 20th century due to the loss of horse-drawn transport and generally cleaner streets. The overall national decline since the 1970s masks much heterogeneity in trend among regional populations, and evidence suggests that population processes in the House Sparrow may be relatively fine-grained.

TI  - Factors influencing the small-scale distribution of House Sparrows Passer domesticus in a suburban environment
AU  - Wilkinson, Nicholas
T2  - Bird Study
AB  - Capsule Suburban House Sparrows prefer gardens with native bushes but show no detectable response to garden insecticide use. Aims To identify the factors that influence House Sparrow distribution among suburban gardens. Methods Bicycle transects were used to survey House Sparrows in front gardens in suburban Oxford in the spring of 2004. A subset of 498 gardens was selected comprising all those where sparrows were found and an equal number of randomly selected sparrow-free gardens. In each of these gardens the density of bushes and the proportion of native bushes were recorded and insecticide use and house age were sampled by questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to compare these variables with the presence or absence of House Sparrows. A larger scale analysis was also conducted comparing 25 squares, each 250 m(2). The density of House Sparrows in the total area of front gardens in these squares was compared to the area of green space within the square, its distance from the city edge and encounter rates of corvids on the cycle transects. Results House Sparrows show a preference for gardens with native bushes. They also prefer gardens with a higher overall density of bushes but appear to make no distinction based on insecticide use or house age. There is no evidence that green space, distance from the city edge or density of corvids affect sparrow numbers of a larger spatial scale. Conclusion House Sparrows might benefit from planting of native bushes but not apparently from a reduction in garden insecticide use. The preference for native vegetation most likely reflects the associated abundance of insect food, which is required by the growing chicks. Further investigation of the habits of House Sparrows in the breeding season may shed light on the causes of the recent decline of the species.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Bird species richness (S) and numbers (N) were studied in the breeding season in housing developments of different ages in a small English town and compared with village sites, urban green corridors and adjacent arable farmland. S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England.

TI  - Urban influence on birds at a regional scale: A case study with the avifauna of northern Madrid province
AU  - Palomino, David
AU  - Carrascal, Luis M.
T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Bird fauna of the Madrid province (Central Spain) was analyzed according to urban development in a landscape mosaic of 700 km(2). Bird distribution and abundance was studied in urban versus several rural habitats and along a gradient of urban typologies. By means of tree regression analyses we identified the most important habitat structure variables affecting bird species richness and density in urban environments. Bird communities in urban environments were globally less diverse and had higher densities than any natural habitat of the study region. The number of urban-avoider species (n = 37) was greater than the number of species favoured by urban habitats (n = 8). Current housing developments of extense crowded terraced-houses, with shortage of gardens, supported the least diverse and dense bird populations. Nevertheless, differences in bird species abundance between urban and natural habitats mitigated in many species when considering the older gardened developments. The plots with the highest species richness (average of 14.5 spp./0.8 ha) were those with 15-28% of building cover, more than 43 medium-sized trees/ha (10-30 cm dbh), and 13-54 small trees/ha (less than 10 cm dbh). Subsequently, future land-use planning should stress the exclusion of urban developments from the most valuable habitats, such as open wooded valley areas devoted to cattle-grazing (mainly ash-groves), and the negative effect of dense, low-gardened housing developments.

T2  - Austral Ecology
AB  - The absence of small birds from many suburban areas may be due to adverse garden characteristics, interspecific aggression or human behaviour such as supplementary food provisioning that encourages predators. We investigated the relationship between these factors and the presence of seven small bird species in Sydney through a community-based survey. The survey was conducted by participants over a 7-day period between 7 AM and 10 AM in November and early December 2000. Three dominant species, the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and common myna (Acridotheres tristis) were each present in over 59% of gardens. Each small bird species was present in less than 40% of gardens. All small birds were negatively associated with noisy miners, but only the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) was negatively associated with pied currawongs. None of the species of small birds was negatively associated with common mynas. Four species of small birds were associated with at least one habitat variable, notably the proportion of native vegetation. Although more birds were recorded in gardens in which meat was provided, there were significantly fewer small birds in these gardens. There were also more birds recorded in gardens where seed was provided, with red-browed finches (Neochmia temporalis) positively associated with seed provisioning in most regions of Sydney. The presence of dogs and cats was not related to the total abundance of birds overall or small birds in gardens. While garden characteristics may influence the presence of small birds to some degree, the presence of noisy miners, a species that are thought to aggressively exclude other species from their territories, is likely to be an important influence on these species in suburban areas. Furthermore, supplementary feeding by people is likely to negatively influence some small birds. The presence of carnivorous pets does not seem to influence the presence of small birds at the scale of the individual garden.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Few urban studies of avian diversity discriminate between native and exotic species, although highly modified urban environments typically support significant numbers of non-native species. High overall diversity may mask poor native diversity. We identify which native species are successful in a variety of urban habitats in a New Zealand city, and examine the roles that garden size and complexity, native fragments, and vegetation composition and cover play in explaining variations in native and exotic avian diversity. Nearly half(44%) of 39 species recorded were exotic four(three exotic and one native) comprised 45% of birds counted. While there was little variation between habitats in combined native and exotic species richness, the number and abundance of bush-dependent natives differed. Similarity measures identified three groups (1) commercial, industrial and residential areas with small structurally simple gardens where 3-4 exotic species were numerically dominant and few bush natives made up <10% of the total count; (2) Suburbs with medium/large gardens dominated by lawns. shrubs and trees, with many exotic species but also several bush natives (comprising 24-32% of the total count); and (3) bush fragments where both diversity and species richness of bush natives were highest (comprising 50-75% of the total count), including four insectivores absent from all residential areas. Vegetation structure, composition and cover, and proximity to fragments did not explain much of the variation in total or native species richness and diversity, but did explain 69% and 72% of bush-native species richness and abundance respectively.

AU  - Murgui, Enrique
T2  - Journal of Ornithology
AB  - The habitat selection and the factors influencing the distribution of the House Sparrow Passer domesticus in the municipality of Valencia (76 km(2)) were studied during the winter and breeding season. House Sparrows positively selected urban parks and gardens, patches of derelict land and horticultural fields; they avoided the built- up habitat and the orange groves. In the urban landscape, the abundance of sparrows peaked in areas providing intermediate cover of the built- up habitat; it was positively driven by the amount of park land per unit area, and negatively by the size of urban parks. Our results suggest that the conservation and habitat enhancement of even the smallest parks and gardens are likely key factors in addressing the decline of the House Sparrow in many cities.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - We assessed the impact of domestic cats on population persistence of native and exotic urban bird populations using a model adjusted for habitat-specific catch rates, cat ownership and hunting activity data. GPS-derived home ranges of 32 cats and resource selection indices demonstrated the degree of penetration and preference for native vegetation fragments. Owners reported on prey brought back by 144 domestic cats in Dunedin, New Zealand, during 12 months. One third of cats never brought back prey, and 21% returned more than one item/month. Cats brought back a mean of 13.4 prey items/year (median = 4), with cats aged <1 year returning more prey than older cats. Birds were the most common prey, followed by rodents. Although cats penetrated adjacent vegetation fragments they did not catch more birds and preferred garden habitat, suggesting that predation pressure may be reduced in fragments. Cat home range size appears to be constrained by cat density while the number of birds caught depends on the density of available prey. Estimates of city-wide catch for six bird species were either more than total urban population size estimates or close to lower confidence intervals. Modelling of three species indicated low likelihood of population persistence with cat predation. The observed persistence of these prey species suggests a meta-population structure with urban populations acting as sinks with source populations located on the city fringe.

AU  - Orros, Melanie E.

T2  - Basic and Applied Ecology
AB  - Providing supplementary food for wild birds is a globally popular pastime; almost half of the households in many developed countries participate and billions of US dollars are spent annually. Although the direct influence of this additional resource on bird survivorship and fecundity has been studied, there is little understanding of the wider ecological consequences of this massive perturbation to (what are usually) urban ecosystems. We investigated the possible effects of wild bird feeding on the size and survivorship of colonies of a widespread arthropod prey species of many small passerine birds, the pea aphid [Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris); Hemiptera Aphididae], in suburban gardens in a large town in southern England. We found significantly fewer aphids and shorter colony survival times in colonies exposed to avian predation compared to protected controls in gardens with a bird feeder but no such differences between exposed and protected colonies in gardens that did not feed birds. Our work therefore suggests that supplementary feeding of wild birds in gardens may indirectly influence population sizes and survivorship of their arthropod prey and highlights the need for further research into the potential effects on other species.

T2  - New Zealand Journal of Ecology
AB  - The New Zealand Garden Bird Survey started in 2007 primarily to monitor long-term trends in common garden bird populations. The method was based on the Big Garden Birdwatch in the UK. Volunteers spent one hour in midwinter each year recording for each bird species the largest number of individuals detected at any one time in their garden, as an index of abundance. A large number of species was recorded, the two most numerous being house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). There was regional variation in species occurrence and abundance; more species and more individuals of most species in rural than in urban gardens; more individuals of some species and fewer of others in gardens where supplementary food was provided; and changes in the abundance of some species over the 4 years. Potential problems with the methodology and interpretation of the data are discussed. As a consequence of convenience sampling the results apply only to the gardens of participants, not necessarily New Zealand as a whole. The survey has the potential to alert authorities to changes in garden bird population trends, and to provide circumstantial evidence of the success or otherwise of management actions such as restoration planting.

AU  - Pauw, Anton
AU  - Louw, Kirsten
T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - Urbanization is a widespread and rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, therefore we need a predictive understanding of its effects on species and ecosystem processes. In this paper we study the impact of urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed the composition of the guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat. Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild. Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city, whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild of pollinators can potentially be restored, but the pros and cons of this conservation action need to be considered.

T2  - Ecosystems
AB  - Domestic gardens collectively cover substantial areas within cities and play an important role in supporting urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The extent of their contribution to urban biodiversity is ultimately determined by the attitudes, motivations, and practices of their owners. We identified variables characterizing individual householders and their properties that explained variation in perennial plant and avian species richness and plant diversity among 55 gardens in New Zealand. The size of the vegetated area was most important in explaining bird and plant diversity, independent of property size. Also important and positively associated with plant richness were socio-economic status and ability to discriminate between native and exotic species. Median housing age and neighborhood green space were less important. Contrary to expectations, better educated householders who demonstrated pro-environmental orientation (NEP) did not necessarily have gardens with greater plant diversity, however, people with higher NEP scores tended to have gardens with more structurally complex vegetation. Similar variables were important in explaining native and exotic species richness, but higher exotic plant diversity was associated with older people with smaller properties of lower value. Avian species richness increased primarily with vegetated area, but also the areas of beds and hedges. We demonstrate that although householder knowledge is an important determinant of garden biodiversity, vegetated area is most important. Promoting urban garden biodiversity requires that larger vegetated properties be supported and encouraged, and that planners should consider biodiversity when formulating policies concerning garden size, property size, and consents that may result in a progressive increase in the proportion of built over/paved areas.

We use BTO Nest Record Scheme (NRS) data to explore the demographic drivers of variation in this metric and relate differences to BTO/Joint Nature Conservation Committee/Royal Society for Protection of Birds Breeding Bird Survey regional population trends.Results GBW annual productivity was similar between rural and urban gardens but was lower in the south and the east of Britain (1.32 fledglings per adult), where populations are declining, than in the north and west where populations are stable (1.37 fledglings per adult). Analysis of NRS data showed similar regional variation in clutch and broods sizes.Conclusion The intensity of effort required to measure breeding success directly through nest monitoring has limited the scale of data collection but these results suggest that Garden BirdWatch (GBW) data can provide a measure of annual productivity across multiple sites. Regional variation in annual productivity (primarily driven by reduced clutch sizes) mirrors population trends, suggesting that reduced breeding success may be influencing House Sparrow population recovery.

T2  - Behavioral Ecology
AB  - Resource competition is one potential behavioral mechanism by which invasive species can impact native species, but detecting this competition can be difficult due to the interactions that variable environmental conditions can have on species behavior. This is particularly the case in urban habitats where the disturbed environment can alter natural behavior from that in undisturbed habitats. The rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), is an increasingly common invasive species, predominantly associated with large urban centers. Using an experimental approach, we tested the behavioral responses of native garden birds in response to the presence of a rose-ringed parakeet versus the presence of a similarly sized and dominant native bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). Parakeet presence significantly reduced feeding rates and increased vigilance among native birds compared with our control treatments. Of visits made by native birds in the presence of a parakeet, feeding was more likely to occur in sites within the parakeet range compared with sites outside, suggesting some habituation of native birds has occurred following prior exposure to parakeets but overall foraging behavior is still disrupted. The results of our study suggest that nonnative species can have complex and subtle impacts on native fauna and show that a nonnative competitor can impact native species simply through their presence near resources.

T2  - Global Change Biology
AB  - Human activities are causing rapid environmental change at a global scale. Urbanization is responsible for some of the most extreme human-altered habitats and is a known driver of evolutionary change, but evidence and understanding of these processes is limited. Here, we investigate the potential underlying mechanisms contributing to the contemporary evolution of migration behaviour in the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla). Blackcaps from central Europe have been wintering in urban areas of Britain with increasing frequency over the past 60years, rather than migrating south to the Mediterranean. It has been hypothesized that the popularization of providing supplementary foods for wild birds within Britain may have influenced this marked migratory change, but quantifying the selective forces shaping evolutionary changes remains challenging. Using a long-term national scale data set, we examine both the spatial distribution and interannual variation in blackcap wintering behaviour in Britain in relation to supplementary food availability and local climate. Over a 12-year period, we show that blackcaps are becoming increasingly associated with the provision of supplementary foods in British gardens, and that the reliability of bird food supplies is influencing their winter distribution at a national scale. In addition, local climatic temperatures and broader scale weather variation are also important determinants of blackcap wintering patterns once they arrive in Britain. Based on our findings, we conclude that a synergistic effect of increased availability of feeding resources, in the form of garden bird food, coupled with climatic amelioration, has enabled a successful new wintering population to become established in Britain. As global biodiversity is threatened by human-induced environmental change, this study presents new and timely evidence of the role human activities can play in shaping evolutionary trajectories.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Supplementary feeding of wild birds by domestic garden-holders is a globally widespread and popular form of human-wildlife interaction, particularly in urban areas. Vast amounts of energy are thus being added to garden ecosystems. However, the potential indirect effects of this activity on non-avian species have been little studied to date, with the only two previous studies taking place under experimentally manipulated conditions. Here we present the first evidence of a localised depletive effect of wild bird feeding on ground beetles (Coleoptera Carabidae) in suburban gardens under the usual feeding patterns of the garden-holders. We trapped significantly fewer ground beetles directly under bird-feeding stations than in matched areas of habitat away from feeders. Video analysis also revealed significantly higher activity by ground-foraging birds under the feeding stations than in the control areas. Small mammal trapping revealed no evidence that these species differ in abundance between gardens with and without bird feeders. We therefore suggest that local increases in ground-foraging activity by bird species whose diets encompass arthropods as well as seed material are responsible for the reduction in ground beetle numbers. Our work therefore illustrates that providing food for wild birds can have indirect negative effects on palatable prey species under typical conditions.

T2  - Acta Ornithologica
AB  - Feeding wild bird is popular in domestic gardens across the world, with around half of households in the UK, North America and Australia doing so. Nevertheless, there is surprisingly little empirical information on many aspects of the activity. We sought to characterise garden bird feeding in a large UK urban area in two ways. First, we conducted face-to-face questionnaires with a representative cross-section of residents. Just over half fed birds, the majority doing so year-round and at least weekly. Second, a 2-year, longitudinal study recorded all foodstuffs put out by households on every provisioning occasion. In this way, we obtained the first year-round quantitative records of the amounts and types of wild bird food provided in individual gardens. A median of 127 g, equivalent to 628 kcal, was given daily per household (typically consisting of several food types). We estimated the daily cost of this provisioning level to be UK 0.35 pound per household based on the relative proportions of each food type. Provisioning level was not significantly influenced by weather or season. Comparisons between the data sets revealed significantly less frequent feeding amongst the feeders in the longitudinal study (assumed to be 'keen' feeders owing to their participation in this long-term study and numbers of food types provided) than the face-to-face questionnaire respondents, suggesting that questionnaires relying upon participants' estimates rather than records of provisioning may overestimate actual provisioning frequency. Assuming 100% uptake, the median provisioning level equates to sufficient supplementary resources across the UK to fully support 196 million individuals of a hypothetical average garden-feeding bird species (based on 10 common UK garden-feeding birds' energy requirements). This compares with an estimated total of 71 million breeding individuals of these 10 species in the UK (non-breeding numbers unknown). Taking the lowest provisioning level recorded (101 kcal/day) as a conservative measure, 31 million of these average individuals could theoretically be supported.

TI  - Woody cover does not promote activity of nest predators in residential yards

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Urban development often affects resource availability in ways that can influence not only community structure, but key species interactions that shape population dynamics. Although some resources are unintentionally altered, others are deliberately changed to improve habitat for urban wildlife, particularly songbirds. We hypothesized that management strategies that encourage planting trees and shrubs (i.e. increasing woody cover) would inadvertently attract predators of bird nests, which are generally abundant within cities. To test this, we examined the relationship between percent woody cover, pooled across trees and shrubs, and diurnal activity patterns of nest predators in residential yards. We surveyed predator activity and characterized habitat using aerial imagery of seven suburban neighborhoods in Franklin County, Ohio during April-August 2011 and 2012. Predator activity varied widely among individual yards, but contrary to our hypothesis, the availability of woody cover at either yard or neighborhood scales was not a strong predictor of diurnal activity in yards for five common species of nest predators (Eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis; common grackle, Quiscalus quiscala; brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater; blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata; and domestic cat, Fells catus). Thus, our study suggests that wildlife habitat management or gardening programs that recommend increasing woody cover do not necessarily attract some common predators of songbird nests in Midwestern landscapes. Additional research that identifies which habitat features beyond woody cover best predict nest predator activity will facilitate the creation of management recommendations that increase the conservation value of urban environments for songbirds.

TI  - Widespread supplementary feeding in domestic gardens explains the return of reintroduced Red Kites Milvus milvus to an urban area
AU  - Orros, Melanie E.
AU  - Fellowes, Mark D. E.
T2  - Ibis
AB  - Reintroductions are commonly used to mitigate biodiversity loss. One prominent example is that of the Red Kite Milvus milvus, a charismatic raptor of conservation concern. This species has been reintroduced across the UK over the last 25years following its near extinction after centuries of persecution. The species was not expected to recolonize urban areas; its historical association with human settlements is attributed to scavenging on human waste and refuse, a resource now greatly reduced on the streets of modern European cities. However, the species has become a common daytime visitor to a large conurbation centred on the town of Reading, southern England, approximately 20km from the first English reintroduction site. Given a near-absence of breeding and roost sites, we investigated foraging opportunities and habitat associations that might explain use by Red Kites of this urban area. Surveys of discarded human foods and road-kill suggested that these could support at most 13-29 Kites per day. Face-to-face surveys of a cross-section of residents revealed that 4.5% (equivalent to 4349 households) provided supplementary food for Red Kites in their gardens. Using estimates of per-household resource provision from another study, we calculated that this is potentially sufficient to feed 142-320 Kites, a substantial proportion of the total estimated to visit the conurbation each day (between 140 and 440). Road transects found positive associations between Red Kites and residential areas. We suggest that the decision made by thousands of householders to provide supplementary food for Red Kites in their gardens is the primary factor explaining their daytime abundance in this urban area.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - As urbanization increases, the identification of nest predators becomes important for avian conservation and management of urban wildlife communities. We investigated bird nest predation using artificial nests in urban areas of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. From June 2013 through February 2014 we installed seventy-five artificial nests in 25 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi municipalities of KZN. Euplectes spp. nests were used and baited with two quail-sized, hand-made, silicon eggs. These were placed in residential gardens and monitored by camera traps for 2-weeks in winter, spring and summer respectively. Generally bird nesting occurs throughout the year in KZN's subtropical climate, with some avoidance during the autumn season. Therefore, experiments were not conducted during autumn, as fresh nests were not available for use. Overall the rate of predation on artificial nests was 25 % (n = 19), with vervet monkeys Ceropithecus aethiops pygerythrus predating 20 % (n = 17) of the nests while domestic cats Felis catus predated 3 % (n = 2) of nests. Nest predation was significantly higher in the winter season, with 79 % of depredations occurring in winter (n = 15), 16 % in spring (n = 3) and 5 % in summer (n = 1), and in areas with less canopy cover. Our results suggest that vervet monkeys may have a negative impact on nesting birds in urban environments, however, in order to assess the rate of predation experiments on natural nests coupled with information on fledgling success is deemed necessary to investigate avian population declines.

AB  - Wildlife living in the suburbs faces the challenge of dealing with human presence and yard management (including the occurrence of pets) which vary at the scale of the house block. This study examined the influence of ecological factors (e.g. extent of grass and food availability) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity and garden usage) on breeding site choice and reproductive success of the ground-nesting masked lapwing Vanellus miles on Phillip Island, Australia. Lapwings nested less frequently in residential properties (high levels of human usage) compared with vacant blocks and holiday houses. They were also more likely to breed on properties with high food availability and larger areas of grass. None of these variables influenced clutch size or the probability of eggs hatching, although larger clutches and higher hatching rates tended to be associated with more food. This study shows that, for an urban exploiting species, habitat quality is not homogenous at the scale of the house block, and that human activity is avoided by a species generally considered highly tolerant of people.

AB  - Background Intentional winter bird feeding in gardens is one of the most common interactions between birds and humans. Because feeding may have both desired effects (provisioning of nutritious food for under-nourished birds) and undesired effects (favouritism of competitively superior species, transmission of disease), management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to experimentally test winter food preferences of birds, with underlying potential influence of habitat (rural vs. urban) on realised food preferences pattern. Methods We conducted an experimental analysis of food preferences of wintering birds by provided bird-feeders in urban and rural environments across Poland. Data were collected twice during winter 2013-2014 across Poland, in total with 80 experimental trials. Results Sunflower seeds were the most preferred food supplement both in urban and rural habitats, significantly more exploited than any other food simultaneously available in feeders (animal fat, millet seed and dry fruits of row-anberry). However, no significant differences were recorded between urban and rural habitats in use of food. Conclusions The degree of use of a particular type of food at bird-feeders depended on the overall use of food in a bird-feeder-consumption of each of the four types of food was significantly positively correlated with that of the others, and it was positively correlated with the number of birds observed at the feeders.

AB  - Over 11 years, the presence of bird species detected within a garden in Kaikoura, New Zealand, were recorded on a weekly basis. Of the 19 species, Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula merula), house sparrow (Passer domesticus domesticus) and common starling (Sturnus vulgaris vulgaris) were most commonly detected followed by silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most commonly detected native bird. New Zealand falcon (Falco novaeseelandiae), Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) and California quail (Callipepla californica brunnescens) were each seen once. Others recorded were bellbird (Anthornis melanura melanura), chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs), common redpoll (Carduelis flammea), dunnock (Prunella modularis), European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis britannica), European greenfinch (Carduelis chloris), grey warbler (Gerygone igata), red-billed gull (Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), South Island fantail (Rhipidura fuliginosa fuliginosa), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and welcome swallow (Hirundo neoxena neoxena). Ten species exhibited significant seasonal variation; 4 showed significant increases and 2 decreases over the 11 years of the study. This study has shown that simple presence/absence observations of a species on a weekly basis can provide an index of numbers, and demonstrate seasonal movements and medium-term changes of bird species within an urban garden.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - African woolly-necked storks (Ciconia microscelis) depend on wetland habitats for foraging and nesting in natural environments. Recently, they have started colonising urban environments in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and are now a common sight in suburban areas in particular. There have been some anecdotal reports on supplementary feeding of this species by households in some urban areas where they are common. However, these reports have never been confirmed and therefore the extent of feeding and lack thereof is unknown. Using a questionnaire survey, we therefore investigated the extent (if any) to which householders in urban and suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal provide supplementary food to African woolly-necked storks. We also determined the feeders' provisioning habits, and identified the motivation behind and attitudes toward feeding. We found that a significant number of householders fed African woolly-necked storks on a daily basis throughout the year. The majority of respondents provided meat while others provided inappropriate food such as bread. Respondents were most often motivated to feed for personal pleasure. Our results showed that this species is successfully utilising and exploiting anthropogenic food - a novel behaviour. The observations and narratives from respondents strongly suggest that the African woolly-necked stork is present throughout the year, contrary to the perception that this species is migratory during winter. Based on the results obtained in this study, supplementary feeding of African woolly-necked stork by householders is relatively common, widespread and established in suburban areas of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, reported inappropriate feeding may create concerns regarding the health status of African woolly-necked storks in urban population. Therefore, to prevent further detrimental effects and potential human-wildlife conflicts we recommend that suitable feeding guidelines be formulated.

AB  - There is a multi-billion dollar global industry dedicated to feeding wild birds in residential gardens. This extraordinary boost to food resources is almost certainly reshaping entire bird communities, yet the large-scale, long-term impacts on community ecology remain unknown. Here we reveal a 40-year transformation of the bird communities using garden bird feeders in Britain, and provide evidence to suggest how this may have contributed to national-scale population changes. We find that increases in bird diversity at feeders are associated with increasing community evenness, as species previously rarely observed in gardens have increasingly exploited the growing variety of foods on offer over time. Urban areas of Britain are consequently nurturing growing populations of feeder-using bird species, while the populations of species that do not use feeders remain unchanged. Our findings illustrate the on-going, gross impact people can have on bird community structure across large spatial scales.

AB  - The science of urban ecology has increasingly grappled with the long-term ramifications of a globally urbanized planet and the impacts on biodiversity. Some researchers have suggested that places with high species diversity in cities simply reflect an extinction debt of populations that are doomed to extinction but have not yet disappeared. The longitudinal studies conducted to date have found species composition shifting with urbanization but have not always documented continued species extirpations post-urbanization. We used long-term monitoring data on birds from the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix, Arizona, to measure changes in residential bird communities, species-habitat relationships, and human perceptions of bird species diversity over a five-year period. Bird richness, occupancy, and abundance decreased, as did the percentage of respondents satisfied with bird variety in their neighborhoods. As in previous analyses for this region, we found that desert specialist species were associated with neighborhoods with xeric landscaping consisting of gravel groundcover, and drought-tolerant, desert-adapted vegetation. These species were also found in neighborhoods with high per capita income rates and lower percentages of renters and I Iispanic/Latinx residents. Non-native species were positively associated with neighborhoods containing mesic yards with grass and other water-intensive vegetation. The proportions of yards in our surveyed neighborhoods with these distinct landscaping types likewise remained relatively stable over five-year period. Although habitat-species relationships remained unchanged, we detected significant loss of species across the sampling period. Declines were not confined to desert specialist species but included generalist and invader species as well. The parallel reduction in residents' satisfaction suggests that people perceive some aspect of this environmental degradation. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying these species losses may reveal options for retaining some desert specialist species, and the uniqueness they contribute to urban fauna.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - A diversity of indigenous and alien wildlife persists in suburbia, and provides residents with the opportunity to experience wildlife. Suburban gardens may serve as refugia and foraging grounds for many primate species allowing them to populate within a largely urbanized landscape. However, this has led to the increasing human interactions with them, resulting in conflict. Our study investigated the perceptions of suburban residents towards urban vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus within the Msunduzi and Ethekwini municipalities, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We assessed how these related to the monkeys' presence, activities and interactions in residential gardens, and the value of wildlife to residents. Assessment was conducted through an online questionnaire survey. General attitudes of residents to vervet monkeys were canvassed by assessing the respondents' level of active engagement in wildlife watching within their properties. We analyzed 603 surveys submitted online using logistic regression and ordinal regression models. We ascertained that vervet monkeys were disliked by 29% of residents due to their aggressiveness, destructive behaviour in gardens and households, and perceived threat to native wildlife. Frequency and duration of foraging vervet monkeys in residents' gardens was influenced by the presence of pet dogs, fruiting trees, tall trees (> 2 m), ratio of indigenous to alien vegetation of gardens, residency type, and active and passive food provisioning. Despite conflict, the majority of respondents appreciated urban wildlife (67%) and actively engaged in wildlife watching (88%), emphasizing the importance of incorporating human dimension values into the management of urban biodiversity. Our study highlights the value of citizen science in providing mechanisms for identifying priority management and conservation efforts at the highly complex human-wildlife interface in an urbanized landscape.

AB  - Due to loss of natural habitats, human-dominated green spaces are likely to increase in importance for biodiversity support. We assessed the potential value of urban "green roofs" for native pollinator conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city-park green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs, though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats. Green-roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other, while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two habitat types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat characteristics at both the site and landscape scales. Overall, bee abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of green space in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass. At the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and plant-community composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas, particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging resources, and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting habits.

AB  - Across Europe, hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) appear to be in decline in both urban and rural landscapes. Current methods used to monitor urban populations are, however, associated with several potential limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4%, indicating that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence; conversely, 34.7% of householders were not able to correctly predict hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across Reading, but detected in only 32-40% of gardens. None of the within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog friendly.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - According to the national policy, overall forest and agroforestry cover in Rwanda is to increase up to 30% land cover by 2020. On the other hand, demographic data reveal that Rwanda's urban areas are among the fastest-growing on the continent. Unfortunately, there is only little information of the effects of such a rapid urbanization on tree cover and green space structure, knowing that data on urban plant assemblages in the country are rather rare. The paper discusses developments in Kigali's green spaces with regard to its rapid rate of expansion. An integrated approach of research, combining results from interview sessions, desk-based investigations, walk-over and vegetation surveys, and photogrammetric analyses of remotely acquired imagery was applied. The findings suggest that the city green space network consists of plant assemblages largely dominated by alien species (75%). Tree cover fraction averaged at around 10-35%. No significant difference was observed between field-drawn and photogrammetric-based fraction of tree cover estimates; making the later a quick but cheap tool for rapid tree cover evaluation. Cultivated forests, urban woodlots and domestic garden tree stands are far the most dominant types of green spaces in terms of coverage of city surface area. Street tree communities and institutional gardens appear to be the most intensively designed green space layouts. Both distribution and species composition in domestic gardens were socioeconomic-driven. For instance, palm trees were characteristic of fortunate quarters while fruitbearing ornamental such as Psidium guajava and Persea americana were common within scattered and informal settlements. Markhamia lutea, Erythina abyssinica, Euphorbia candelabrum, Phoenix reclinata and Acacia sieberiana are among native taxa that thrive to keep a place in the city. Euphorbia tirucalli, a native tree that is widespread in home compound fences within informal settlements, is significantly declining as modern housing expands and concrete-based fences replace live enclosures.

T2  - World Scientific News
AB  - Biodiversity declines due to unplanned urbanization as well as anthropogenic activities. It has already been documented that native flora and fauna are disappearing as an impact of biodiversity loss. There should be urgent need to restore our lost habitats through conservation techniques. The present study was aimed to conserve and restore lost habitat of pollinators with special reference to butterflies in an urban area through setting up a garden. The study was divided into two phases. In the first phase survey of butterflies found within an unmanaged garden in the campus (Lady Brabourne College, Kolkata) was performed prior to construction activity (May 2012 to October, 2012) and it was observed previously total 31 species of butterfly visited the garden. Developmental activities caused a sharp decline in their population causing an approach to relocate our garden in another area of college campus. In the second phase, setting up a garden in an alternative sites of same campus with plantation of host plants preferred by butterfly species was done and observed for butterfly visit. A slow increase in sighting over a study period of two years (between October, 2012 to June, 2015) was recorded. The results clearly indicate that total 43 species of butterflies were recorded in the garden including 9 species, which were not seen before and with 8 species completing their life cycles. In conclusion, declining of butterfly species can be increased and conserved through setting up of a garden. Presently the garden is flourishing but problems of increase in natural enemies as birds and other anthropogenic disturbances such as excess noise and vibration, street lighting, human interference etc. should be addressed in future within present conservation approach.

AB  - We assessed bee diversity and abundance in urban areas of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to determine how urban environments can support bees. Habitats examined were community and botanical gardens, urban wild areas, Naturescape flower beds and backyards, and traditional flower beds and backyards. A total of 56 bee species (Hymenoptera), including species of the genera Andrena Fabr. (Andrenidae), Bombus Latr. (Apidae), Osmia Panzer and Megachile Latr. (Megachilidae), and Halictus Latr. and Dialictus Pauly (Halictidae), were collected. Abundance exhibited strong seasonal variation. Wild bees were most abundant during late spring, whereas honey bees peaked at the end of the summer. The most abundant species seen was the managed honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Apidae), followed by wild Bombus flavifrons Cresson. Community and botanical gardens, and plants such as cotoneaster (Cotoneaster Medik. sp.) and blackberry (Rubus discolor Weihe & Nees) (Rosaceae), centaurea (Centaurea L. sp.; Asteraceae), buttercup (Ranunculus L. sp.; Ranunculaceae), and foxglove (Digitalis L. sp.; Scrophulariaceae), had the highest abundance of bees, while bee populations in wild areas were the most diverse. Weeds such as dandelions (Taraxacum officinale G.H. Weber ex Wiggers; Asteraceae) dominated these wild areas and had one of the highest diversities of bee visitors. Traditional flower beds with tulips (Tulipa L. sp.; Liliaceae) and petunias (Petunia Juss. sp.; Solanaceae) had relatively poor diversity and abundance of bees throughout the year. Our study suggests that urban areas have the potential to be important pollinator reservoirs, especially if both bloom and habitat heterogeneity are maintained and enhanced through sustainable urban planning.

T2  - Annals of the Entomological Society of America
AB  - We describe the richness, abundance, and ecological characteristics of bees in community gardens located in heavily developed neighborhoods of the Bronx and East Harlem, NY. In total, 1,145 individual bees, representing 54 species (13% of the recorded New York State bee fauna), were collected over 4 yr. The nesting habits of these species include bees that nest in cavities (33% of species), hives (11% of species), pith (1.9% of species),wood (1.9% of species), or soft/rotting wood (7.4% of species) substrates. Soil-nesting individuals were relatively rare (25% of individuals), perhaps due to a lack of proper soils for nesting sites. Parasitic species were scarce (5.6% of species, 2.6% of individuals), most likely because of an absence or rarity of host species. Overall, exotic species were abundant and constituted 27% of the total individuals collected and 19% of the identified species. We compare these results to several bee faunal surveys in New Jersey and New York State, including newly reported species lists for Central Park and Prospect Park in New York City. Relative to other studies, bee richness of the urban gardens is reduced and composition is biased toward exotic and cavity-nesting species. Nevertheless, despite their small size and location within highly urbanized areas, urban community gardens harbor a diverse assemblage of bees that may provide pollination services and opportunities for ecological exposure and education.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - With their abundant floral resources, urban community gardens have the potential to play an important role in pollinator conservation. At the same time, the gardens themselves are dependent upon the pollination services provided by insects. Thus, understanding the variables that can increase bee richness or abundance in community gardens can contribute to both urban agriculture and pollinator conservation. Here we examine the impact of several environmental variables on bee abundance and diversity in urban community gardens in Sydney, Australia. We used hand netting and trap nests to sample bees in 27 community gardens ranging from inner city gardens with limited surrounding green space, to suburban gardens located next to national parks. We did not find strong support for an impact of any of our variables on bee species richness, abundance or diversity. We found high abundance of a recently introduced non-native bee the African carder bee, Afranthidium repetitum (Schulz 1906). The abundance of African carder bees was negatively correlated with the amount of surrounding green space and positively correlated with native bee abundance/species richness. Our results highlight the seemingly rapid increase in African carder bee populations in inner city Sydney, and we call for more research into this bee's potential environmental impacts. Our results also suggest that hard-to-change environmental factors such as garden size and distance to remnant forests may not have a strong influence on native bee diversity and abundance in highly urbanized area.

TI  - Biodiversity in urban gardens: Assessing the accuracy of citizen science data on garden hedgehogs
AU  - Williams, Rachel L.

AU  - Goodenough, Anne E.
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban gardens provide a rich habitat for species that are declining in rural areas. However, collecting data in gardens can be logistically-challenging, time-consuming and intrusive to residents. This study examines the potential of citizen scientists to record hedgehog sightings and collect habitat data within their own gardens using an online questionnaire. Focussing on a charismatic species meant that the number of responses was high (516 responses were obtained in six weeks, with a ~50:50 % split between gardens with and without hedgehog sightings). While many factors commonly thought to influence hedgehog
presence (e.g. compost heaps) were present in many hedgehog-frequented gardens, they were not discriminatory as they were also found in gardens where hedgehogs were not seen. Respondents were most likely to have seen hedgehogs in their garden if they had also seen hedgehogs elsewhere in their neighbourhood. However, primary fieldwork using hedgehog ‘footprint tunnels’ showed that hedgehogs were found to be just as prevalent in gardens in
which hedgehogs had previously been reported as gardens where they had not been reported. Combining these results indicates that hedgehogs may be more common in urban and semiurban gardens than previously believed, and that casual volunteer records of hedgehogs may be influenced more by the observer than by habitat preferences of the animal. When verified, volunteer records can provide useful information, but care is needed in interpreting these data.

TI  - Botanical origin of pollen collected by Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier (Hymenoptera Apidae) in a suburb of Pretoria, South Africa

T2  - African Entomology
AB  - The savannah honeybee, Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier (Hymenoptera Apidae), is a eusocial insect that forages for nectar and pollen on a variety of flowering plants. However, it is selective of plants from which it forages. The preferred species are called bee-plants. The concept of bee-plants recognises that flowers do not have the same pollen and nectar value to honeybees. Thus, the strength of honeybee colonies is dependent on the presence of bee-plants throughout the year at any given locality. A study was conducted during March 2013-February 2015 to establish the presence of bee-plants and their phenology within 2 km radius of the apiary at ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute's farm in Rietondale, a suburb of Pretoria. Atotal of 247 flowering plant species from 70 families, comprising indigenous and exotic trees, shrubs and grasses, was recorded during March 2013-February 2014. Most plant species flowered during April, a smaller proportion during February and October, and only a few during June. Flowers of each plant species were sampled in order to make reference pollen grain slides. To determine bee-plants, a pollen trap was fitted to the entrance of one of five Langstroth hives on a fortnightly rotation during March 2014-February 2015 in order to intercept pollen pellets from the hind legs of returning foragers. A total of 2403 pollen pellets were recovered, most of which (1263) were collected during April and none during October. At the laboratory, about a quarter of each pellet was dissolved in distilled water and pollen grain slides were prepared. These slides were matched against reference pollen grain slides using a compound microscope. It was established that honeybees foraged from only 30 plant species. During summer (December-February), pollen was collected mostly from Persicaria capitata (Polygonaceae), Tithonia rotundifolia (Asteraceae) during autumn (March-May), Acacia galpinnii (Fabaceae) during winter (June-August), and Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae) during spring (September-November). These results show that honeybees had access to pollen sources that were sufficient to sustain their colonies throughout the year. As bee-plants were continuously available in the vicinity of the Rietondale farm, this site could be ideal for urban beekeeping.

TI  - Bumble bee abundance in New York City community gardens implications for urban agriculture
AU  - Matteson, Kevin C.
AU  - Langellotto, Gail A.
T2  - Cities and the Environment
AB  - A variety of crops are grown in New York City community gardens. Although the production of
many crops benefits from pollination by bees, little is known about bee abundance in urban community gardens or which crops are specifically dependent on bee pollination. In 2005, we compiled a list of crop plants grown within 19 community gardens in New York City and classified these plants according to their dependence on bee pollination. In addition, using mark-recapture methods, we estimated the abundance of a potentially important pollinator within New York City urban gardens, the common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens). This species is currently recognized as a valuable commercial pollinator of greenhouse crops. However, wild populations of B. impatiens are abundant throughout its range, including in New York City community gardens, where it is the most abundant native bee species present
and where it has been observed visiting a variety of crop flowers. We conservatively counted 25 species of crop plants in 19 surveyed gardens. The literature suggests that 92% of these crops are dependent, to some degree, on bee pollination in order to set fruit or seed. Bombus impatiens workers were observed visiting flowers of 78% of these pollination-dependent
crops. Estimates of the number of B. impatiens workers visiting individual gardens during the study period ranged from 3 to 15 bees per 100 m2 of total garden area and 6 to 29 bees per 100 m2 of garden floral area. Of 229 B. impatiens workers marked, all recaptured individuals (45%) were found in gardens where they were initially marked. These results indicate an abundance of B. impatiens workers within New York City community gardens and suggest that, at least for certain time periods, many individual workers forage within single gardens. Both findings suggest that B. impatiens may be an especially important pollinator of several common crops grown within community gardens and other urban green spaces that are used for agricultural production. Studies of other pollinating insect species in urban habitats as well as the relationship between pollen movement and seed or fruit set will complement the findings of this study.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - The urban forest of three arctic and near-arctic cities (Murmansk in Russia, Nuuk in Greenland, and Reykjavik in Iceland) were surveyed to determine tree species composition and structure. Interviews with local authorities were conducted to learn about the history of urban tree planting. The urban forests of all three cities were composed of a limited number of trees and tree species due to abiotic constraints of the arctic and near-arctic environment. These limitations include low temperature, short growing season, high wind velocity and permafrost. A total of 28 species were observed in the three cities. Only three of these (Alnus incana (L) Moench, Picea abies (L) Karst., Betula pubescens Ehrh., and Salix glauca L) were observed in all three of the cities. Planting designs that created windbreaks for pedestrians were common along streets in Murmansk and Reykjavik. Street trees have not yet been introduced in Nuuk, but trees were found in cemeteries, parks, and on private property. Older portions of cemeteries in all three cities were characterized by trees planted directly on graves. These grave trees were the first trees to be introduced in these cities. Subsequently, 'trial and error' was used by local residents to plant trees. Much of these plantings failed. In recent times arboreta were established near all three cities to identify species suited for planting under arctic and near-arctic conditions. Trees identified in these test gardens are now being planted in Murmansk and Reykjavik.

T2  - Acta Horticulturae
AB  - The substantial economic and ecological costs of invasive plant management and removal warrant aggressive eradication and prevention programs. Ornamental horticulture has been recognized as the fastest growing segment of U.S. Agriculture, as well as the main source of plant invasions worldwide. Florida ranks second among U.S. states in the degree of ecosystem devastation as a result of exotic invasive species. Cultivated or improved forms of a number of the ornamental species listed as invasive by Floridas Exotic Pest Plant Council have been selected for their attractive flower color, plant form, foliage, drought tolerance, or cold hardiness. As the cultivars are generally propagated vegetatively, relatively little is known about their pollination biology, seed production, seed viability and growth rate under varying conditions. To identify safe alternatives to ornamental invasives, researchers at the University of Florida have evaluated numerous cultivars of Mexican petunia (Ruellia tweediana), privet (Ligustrum spp.), fountain grass (Pennisetum spp.), porterweed (Stachytarpheta spp.), heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica), and lantana (Lantana camara). These species are not only problematic in Florida, but highly invasive in other parts of the world. Research efforts are underway to identify and evaluate sterile non-invasive forms of lantana, heavenly bamboo, and Mexican petunia

TI  - Contrasting impacts of pesticides on butterflies and bumblebees in private gardens in France
AU  - Muratet, Audrey
AU  - Fontaine, Benoît
T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Private gardens are an important food source and refuge for animals in urban areas because they represent a large part of the green space. It has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection on private property, the impact of management practices and in particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens. Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the effect of private garden management on two important groups of flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use), fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators. Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in a highly anthropized, urban landscape.

AU  - Norfolk, Olivia

AU  - Gilbert, Francis
T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Agricultural intensification typically has detrimental effects on pollinator communities, but diverse cropping systems that contain sequentially-flowering crops have the potential to benefit pollinators through the provision of additional floral resources. In this study we investigate the importance of cultivated flora for flower visitors in ten agricultural gardens in South Sinai, Egypt. Insect-flower interactions in gardens and unmanaged plots were surveyed across a four-month period in two environmentally distinct years (pre-flood and post-flood). Despite containing an equal abundance and diversity of wild plants as unmanaged habitat, gardens supported a higher abundance and diversity of flower visitors due to the additional presence of cultivated flora. Visitation networks exhibited dramatic intra-annual changes in composition, with cultivated plants becoming increasingly important in later months. Trends were highly conserved across 2 years despite highly contrasting rainfall. Several key crop species were strongly involved in shaping the structure of the networks, the majority of which were herbs with strong cultural significance (fennel, rosemary, mint) and grown incidentally alongside the primary orchard crops. Minority crops are frequently overlooked in agricultural systems due to their low economic value, but we show that they can have a dramatic influence upon the structure of visitation networks, increasing both pollinator abundance and diversity, and emphasising the link between cultural practices and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Although urban areas are often considered to have uniformly negative effects on biodiversity, cities are most accurately characterized as heterogeneous mosaics of buildings, streets, parks, and gardens that include both good' and bad' areas for wildlife. However, to date, few studies have evaluated how human impacts vary in direction and magnitude across a heterogeneous urban landscape. In this study, we assessed the distribution of floral resources and flower-visiting insects across a variety of land uses in New York City. We visited both green spaces (e.g. parks, cemeteries) and heavily developed neighborhood blocks (e.g. with high or low density residential zoning) and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of median income, vegetation, and development intensity on floral resources and insects in both settings. Abundance and taxonomic richness of flower-visiting insects was significantly greater in green spaces than neighborhood blocks. The SEM results indicated that heavily-developed neighborhoods generally had fewer flower-visiting insects consistent with reductions in floral resources. However, some low-density residential neighborhoods maintained high levels of floral resources and flower-visiting insects. We found that the effects of surrounding vegetation on floral resources, and thus indirect effects on insects, varied considerably between green spaces and neighborhood blocks. Along neighborhood blocks, vegetation consisted of a mosaic of open gardens and sparsely distributed trees and had a positive indirect effect on flower-visiting insects. In contrast, vegetation in urban green spaces was associated with increased canopy cover and thus had a negative indirect effect on flower-visiting insects through reductions in floral resources. In both neighborhood blocks and green spaces, vegetation had a positive direct effect on flower-visiting insects independent of the influence of vegetation on floral resources. Our results demonstrate how inter-related components of an urban ecosystem can vary with respect to one another across a heterogeneous urban landscape, suggesting that it is inappropriate to generalize about urban systems as a whole without first addressing differences among component land use types.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has changed the structure and function of natural ecosystems, especially floodplain ecosystems in SE Asia. The ecological structure of vegetation stands and the usefulness of satellite images was investigated to characterize a disturbed tropical urban forest located in the Chao Phraya River lower floodplain, Thailand. Nine sample plots were established on the Bang Kachao Peninsula (BKP) within 4 tropical forest types in an urban area rehabilitation forest, home-garden agroforestry, mangrove and park. The tree habitats were beach forest, swamp forest, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest, mangrove forest and abandoned orchard or home-garden. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values obtained from Landsat 7 satellite images were correlated with plant structure from field surveys. NDVI had the highest relationship with stand factors for number of families, number of species, Shannon-Weiner index and total basal area. Linear regression predicted well the correlation between NDVI and stand factors for families and basal area. NDVI trends reflected urban tropical forest typing and biodiversity, being high in rehabilitation and mangrove forests, moderate in home-gardens and low in parks. We suggest that the application of NDVI for assessments can be useful for future planning, monitoring and management of the BKP and hence may contribute for increasing biodiversity and complexity of these urban forests.

T2  - Journal of Herpetology
AB  - There is a close link between the habitat of an organism and its behavior, performance, and morphology. Many urban parks and gardens are modified such that the ground layer is more open and less complex than the ground layer of a natural bushland habitat. Garden Skinks (Lampropholis guichenoti) are widespread and common throughout the Sydney region, in both modified and more natural habitats. Garden Skinks might, therefore, exhibit differences in behavior, performance, and morphology between these two habitats. We studied behavior (habitat use and response to a predator), performance (sprint speed), and morphology of Garden Skinks in three modified urban garden habitats and three more natural bushland habitats. Lizards in modified habitats spent significantly more time on bare, flat surfaces farther from refuge than lizards in natural habitats. The distance to which an observer could approach a lizard before it fled (approach distance) was generally greater in modified habitats, and lizards in modified habitats had significantly faster sprint speeds than lizards in natural habitats. Lizard morphology (leg length) did not correlate with lizard performance. Apart from lizards at Modified Site 1 and Natural Site 1, lizards exhibited a similar, generalized body shape that was suited to various sprint speeds. However, the ability of Garden Skinks to exhibit different behaviors and performance levels (given similar body shapes) in structurally different habitats in part may explain why Garden Skinks are referred to as a successful "generalist" species.

AB  - Domestic gardens typically consist of a mixture of native and non-native plants which support biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, particularly in urban environments. Many gardeners wish to encourage biodiversity by choosing appropriate plant taxa. The value of native and non-native plants in supporting animal biodiversity is, however, largely unknown. The relative value of native and non-native garden plants to invertebrates was investigated in a replicated field experiment. Plots (deliberately akin to garden borders) were planted with one of three treatments, representing assemblages of plants based on origin (native, near-native and exotic). Invertebrates and resource measurements were recorded over fouryears. This paper reports the abundance of flower-visiting aerial insects (pollinators') associated with the three plant assemblages. For all pollinator groups on all treatments, greater floral resource resulted in an increase in visits. There was, however, a greater abundance of total pollinators recorded on native and near-native treatments compared with the exotic plots. Short-tongued bumblebees followed the same pattern whilst more hoverflies were recorded on the native treatment than the other treatments, and more honeybees on the near-native treatment. There was no difference between treatments in abundance of long-tongued bumblebees or solitary bees. The lack of difference in solitary bee abundance between treatments was probably due to a third of individuals from this group being recorded on one exotic plant species. The number of flower visitors corresponded to the peak flowering period of the treatments, that is there were fewer flower visitors to the exotic treatment compared with the other treatments in early summer but relatively more later in the season.Synthesis and applications. This experiment has demonstrated that utilizing plants from only a single region of origin (i.e. nativeness) may not be an optimal strategy for resource provision for pollinating insects in gardens. Gardens can be enhanced as a habitat by planting a variety of flowering plants, biased towards native and near-native species but with a selection of exotics to extend the flowering season and potentially provide resources for specialist groups.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Globally with increased urban development, understanding spatial habitat requirements of urban-dwelling wildlife is increasingly important for conservation management. Consequently, we determined the factors that influence the presence of vervet monkeys (Chiorocebus pygerythrus) in urban landscapes. Firstly, we hypothesized that troop size is influenced by seasonality, residence type, proximity to water sources and food provisioning. Secondly, we hypothesized that the resting behaviour of vervet troops is influenced by natural factors, including the presence/absence of raptor nest(s)) and man-made structures including the distance to the nearest main road. Thirdly, we hypothesized that resting by vervet monkey troops would be influenced by the seasons, the distance to the nearest main road (due to the relative openness) and the residence type. Fourthly, we hypothesized that foraging by vervet monkey troops is influenced by food provisioning and bird feeders. Finally, we hypothesized that playing by vervet monkey troops are influenced by the presence/absence of a raptor nest (s), a dog(s) and the residency type. From June 2013 through May 2014 observations were conducted on vervet monkey troops in 20 suburban gardens in the Ethekwini and Msunduzi municipalities of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, following a standardized group scan sample method. The observation data were analyzed to determine population-level patterns of landscape use and key suburban landscape features influencing seasonal behaviour, troop size and sex ratios of vervet monkey troops. Mean troop size (29 3.4 (SE) individuals) was influenced by female and juvenile numbers and sex ratio varied across study sites. Behavioural observations (foraging, grooming, playing) were more frequent during winter in gardens with high tree density, and a preference for visitation was found in gardens closer to roads, and where food was provisioned. Probability of foraging, grooming and playing was higher in gardens with greater canopy cover, however this decreased with increasing troop size. Probability of resting decreased with increasing distance from indigenous forest patches and roads. Gardens experienced high levels of raiding. Understanding vervet monkey spatial ecology within a transformed landscape contributes to determining sustainable ways to mitigate conflict and manage their populations in suburbia.

TI  - Floral abundance, richness, and spatial distribution drive urban garden bee communities
AU  - Plascencia, Montserrat
AU  - Philpott, Stacy M.
T2  - Bulletin of Entomological Research
AB  - In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features. Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.

T2  - Journal of Apicultural Science
AB  - Due to fewer bumblebees in rural areas these days, it is necessary to look for alternative habitats for the active protection of these very important pollinators. The research was carried out in The Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, in Wroclaw, Poland. In the garden, approximately 2000 plant species were cultivated, of which 185 were visited by bumblebees. Amongst them, 57 plant species were deemed very attractive and were determined to be indicators for 7 bumblebee species. Indicator species for bumblebees ranged between 6 for Bombus pratorum to up to 20 for B. pascuorum. Monarda didyma was an indicator plant to 6 recorded bumblebee species. Other indicator plant species for at least 4 bumblebees species were Origanum vulgate, Lavandula angustifolia, Rhododendron catawbiense, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Agastache rugosa. Three bumblebee species were found to forage the most on 11 of the flowering plant species. The biggest group of plants were those which were mostly visited by 1-2 bumblebee species. Amongst all recorded indicator plants, 32% were native species.

AB  - BackgroundRed foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) have become successful inhabitants of urban areas in recent years. However, our knowledge about the occurrence, distribution and association with land uses of these urban foxes is poor, partly because many favoured habitats are on private properties and therefore hardly accessible to scientists. We assumed that citizen science, i.e. the involvement of the public, could enable researchers to bridge this information gap. We analysed 1179 fox sightings in the city of Vienna, Austria reported via citizen science projects to examine relationships between foxes and the surrounding land use classes as well as sociodemographic parameters.ResultsConditional probabilities of encountering foxes were substantially higher in gardens, areas with a low building density, parks or squares as compared to agricultural areas, industrial areas or forests. Generalized linear model analyses showed that sociodemographic parameters such as education levels, district area, population density and average household income additionally improved the predictability of fox sightings.ConclusionsReports of fox sightings by citizen scientists might help to support the establishment of wildlife management in cities. Additionally, these data could be used to address public health issues in relation with red foxes as they can carry zoonoses that are also dangerous to humans.

AU  - Verderame, Mariailaria

T2  - Comptes Rendus Biologies
AB  - The terrestrial lizard Podarcis siculus is the most abundant reptile in Italy, where is considered a ubiquitous species. This lizard is widely distributed from the islands to the Apennines, from cultivated fields to anthropized areas such as gardens and city parks. For this reason, these animals are exposed to extensive physical and chemical stresses, as well as to the possibility of coming into contact with industrial pollutants and substances used in agricultural practices. Here, we review the health status of lizard specimens inhabiting natural non-anthropized areas and fields devoted to organic farming, considering the condition of (1) liver, representing the main detoxifying organ, directly influenced by feeding, and (2) gonads, essential for reproduction and, therefore, for the survival of the species. The morphological and biomolecular condition of these organs was then compared with those obtained from lizard specimens experimentally treated with nonylphenol, a co-formulant of many insecticides and plant protection products widely used in conventional farming, known to have harmful estrogenic effects. Taken together, data demonstrate that lizards inhabiting manured soil are in good health status and show a regular morphology of liver, testis, and ovary. Animals are found to be less exposed to the toxic heavy metals cadmium and lead if compared with specimens collected in areas not devoted to agriculture, but probably more exposed to vehicular traffic. However, manure, as well as nonylphenol, exerts a xeno-estrogenic effect, particularly evident in male specimens, more sensitive to estrogenic contamination.

AU  - Marks, Clive A.

T2  - Wildlife Research
AB  - Selection of natal dens and diurnal shelters by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was investigated within the metropolitan area of Melbourne. Of 72 natal dens, 61% were in residential, public park, school or industrial lands. Most dens were beneath buildings (44.4%) or in earth banks (30.6%). The habitat categories in which dens were sited did not differ significantly from those described for London. Dens were more common beneath weatherboard buildings and were associated with properties that did not contain domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris). Diurnal shelter positions for 20 radio-collared foxes were obtained, and home-range data collected for 11 foxes. Estimated areas of adult home-range, for 100% minimum convex polygons (MCPs), varied between 11.5 and 45.8 ha, with from two to five diurnal shelter sites used in each home-range. Foxes showed a consistent preference for diurnal shelters associated with exotic weed infestations over ornamental and native vegetation or built habitats. Within these categories a diversity of substrates were used, including buildings, drains, graves, cypress trees, ornamental rockeries and garden beds. A preference for exotic weed infestations is an identifiable resource requirement for foxes in Melbourne and its removal may assist in reducing the abundance of urban foxes.

AB  - Urban green spaces and trees provide multiple benefits to urban residents and the sustainability of cities. A poorly examined benefit is the provision of fodder to urban livestock. However, the presence and activities of livestock may be incompatible with other uses, although this has been little studied. We examined the impacts of livestock on trees and parks along a gradient of declining livestock density, complemented with a tree planting experiment to monitor damage. Neighbouring residents and park managers were interviewed regarding their perceptions of damage caused by livestock. The negative impacts on soil compaction, tree damage and death increased with increasing livestock densities. Thorny tree species were damaged significantly less (13 %) than non-thorny species (77 %), as were protected trees (25 %) relative to unprotected ones (65 %). There was more tree damage in public green spaces (PUGS) (54 %) than control sites (38 %). The majority of local residents felt that livestock should not be allowed in formal PUGS, and most urban park managers regarded livestock damage as a strong disincentive to plant trees. These results show the need for management of the trade-offs caused by livestock and greater appreciation of livestock as agents shaping aspects of PUGS.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Even though Brazil is a mega-diverse country, many Brazilian cities prioritize exotic plants in their treescapes. Aiming to evaluate how much the treescape in Fortaleza (the fifth largest city in Brazil) is aligned with the policy of valorization of native biodiversity, we sampled street and backyard trees surrounding one of the few vegetation fragments of the city, which is an area considered a priority for conservation. We used the vegetation fragment's flora as reference to compare the potential number of local native species with the actual number of native species in the treescape of the site. To account how much of the native flora was present in the surrounding treescape, we made an inventory of the trees in streets, squares and backyards around the vegetation and compared with the native flora of the vegetation fragment. We then compared the ratio of native to exotic species and checked how many native species of the fragment were also in the surrounding treescape. Exotics were prevalent in both number of species and number of individuals, comprising 70% of the species and 86% of the individuals of public spaces, and 79% of the species and 78% of the individuals of private spaces. Only 14% of the native species of the vegetation were also represented in the treescape, and, in general, they comprehended only a few individuals. We argue that the city's treescape should be re-evaluated in order to value native plants more. Native plants in the treescape could be used as an environmental education tool to publicize native biodiversity to citizens.

AB  - The increasing numbers and negative impacts of invasive species have prompted research on the relationship between human activities and the success of invasive horticultural plants. In this study, we use population genetic relationships to model the escape of a common garden vine, exotic Wisteria, into natural habitats. Urban and naturalized Wisteria populations in Charleston, South Carolina and Tallahassee, Florida were investigated using a combination of chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Fifty-nine of 72 (81.9%) Wisteria collections were hybrids of Wisteria sinensis and W. floribunda. Chi-square analysis of the distribution of shared W. floribunda haplotypes among naturalized and urban populations supports the relationship of time with invasion success. Naturalized populations were more similar to those in historic neighborhoods. The most common haplotype, F1, was encountered 22 times but its distribution was not significantly different between urban and naturalized populations. In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of haplotype F2 found in naturalized populations suggests that selection may also be acting within these populations. Finally, due to extensive human dispersal, there is no relationship between genetic distance and geographical distance among the populations sampled. We conclude that Wisteria's long history of horticulture, rampant hybridization, and human-aided dispersal are all implicated in the successful ability of these plants to invade natural habitats throughout the USA

T2  - Environmental Entomology
AB  - Urban gardens may preserve biodiversity as urban population densities increase, but this strongly depends on the characteristics of the gardens and the landscapes in which they are embedded. We investigated whether local and landscape characteristics are important correlates of bee (Hymenoptera Apiformes) abundance and species richness in urban community gardens. We worked in 19 gardens in the California central coast and sampled bees with aerial nets and pan traps. We measured local characteristics (i.e., vegetation and ground cover) and used the USGS National Land Cover Database to classify the landscape surrounding our garden study sites at 2 km scales. We classified bees according to nesting type (i.e., cavity, ground) and body size and determined which local and landscape characteristics correlate with bee community characteristics. We found 55 bee species. One landscape and several local factors correlated with differences in bee abundance and richness for all bees, cavity-nesting bees, ground-nesting bees, and different sized bees. Generally, bees were more abundant and species rich in bigger gardens, in gardens with higher floral abundance, less mulch cover, more bare ground, and with more grass. Medium bees were less abundant in sites surrounded by more medium intensity developed land within 2 km. The fact that local factors were generally more important drivers of bee abundance and richness indicates a potential for gardeners to promote bee conservation by altering local management practices. In particular, increasing floral abundance, decreasing use of mulch, and providing bare ground may promote bees in urban gardens.

T2  - Cities and the Environment
AB  - Gardens have become increasingly important places for growing nutritional food, for conserving
biodiversity, for biological and ecological research and education, and for community gathering.
Gardens can also be designed with the goal of attracting specific wildlife, like birds and
butterflies, but pollinators, like bees, can also be drawn to specially planned and modified
gardens. A community garden in San Luis Obispo, California provided the setting for
modification with the goal of attracting native bee pollinators by planting known bee-attractive
plants. The local gardeners participated in a survey questionnaire and focused interviews to
provide their input and interest in such a project. Presentations on our work with native bees in
urban environments and gardening to attract bees were also given to interested gardeners. Work
of this type also benefited from a lead gardener who managed donated bee plants and kept up
momentum of the project. Modification of the garden and monitoring of native bees started in
2007 and continued through the growing season of 2009. Diversity of collected and observed
native bees has increased each year since 2007. To date, 40 species in 17 genera of mostly native
bees has been recorded from the garden, and this number is expected to increase through time.

T2  - Pan-Pacific Entomologist
AB  - University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces. and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25 species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar, 1848, represented over 50% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat, indicating the importance of 'butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117 spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design input), of which 58% were native. Total plant richness was positively correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76% of the spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect people to nature.

AB  - The role of urban expansion on bee diversity is poorly understood, but it may play an important role in restructuring pollinator diversity observed in rural regions at the urban perimeter. We studied bee communities in two habitats essential for pollinators (residential gardens and semi-natural areas) at 42 sites situated at the edge of greater Montreal, Canada. Bee species richness, abundance and functional diversity all increased with urbanization in both habitat types, but gardens and semi-natural areas supported distinct bee communities with unique responses to urbanization in terms of species turnover. Compared to semi-natural sites, residential gardens supported bees that foraged from a greater number but a lower proportion of available plant species. Bees did not discriminate between exotic and indigenous plant species in either gardens or semi-natural sites and were attracted to flowers in either habitat irrespective of their origins. Protecting semi-natural ruderal areas and providing residential garden habitats for pollinators are both effective means of promoting regional bee diversity in urbanizing regions.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Urban green areas, due to their high plant diversity, can be supportive as floral resources (nectar and/or pollen) to wild and managed pollinating insects. This research aims towards understanding the contribution of ornamental ground cover perennials as a food source for urban pollinators. We compare floral phenology and abundance, nectar and pollen production, and insect visitation to flowers of Geranium macrorrhizum, G. platypetalum and G. sanguineum, planted in the botanical garden of Lublin, SE Poland. The investigation revealed that the studied hardy geraniums exhibit many features valuable for pollinators, including large floral display (G. macrorrhizum and G. platypetalum), extended flowering period (G. sanguineum) and ample nectar and pollen reward (G. macrorrhizum). They can supply urban pollinators with a high quality food during spring and early summer time, i.e. the period of high food demand by many bee species. Moreover, hardy geraniums might be valuable plants for urban beekeeping as they are eagerly visited by honeybees. The investigated ground cover plants could therefore be considered in future city plantings.

AB  - Centris flavifrons is a ground-nesting solitary bee species that has an important role in crop and native plant species pollination in the Neotropical region. However, the nesting biology and ecology of this species are little understood. We studied the nesting biology of C. flavifrons by observing 287 nests in an urban garden. Females built nests only during the dry season from September to March and exhibit notable flexibility in the amount of time each nest is active and the number of brood cells produced as a consequence. Nests were established on horizontal, sunny, sandy surfaces without vegetation. Our nest excavations revealed a main tunnel with lateral branches and an average of five cells per nest (range, 1-12 cells). The duration of a nest from digging to closure was on average 6.9 days (range of 2-19 days, n = 141) with 69 % of nests active for 2-7 days. Mesoplia regalis was observed entering the nests and emerged from the cells of C. flavifrons, but the parasitism rate was low. The implications of this flexibility in nest activity duration and brood cell number and the low pressure from parasites are discussed.

TI  - Pollen specialization by solitary bees in an urban landscape

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Many polylectic bee species are known to specialize locally on one or a few pollen types to increase foraging efficiency. What is relatively unknown is how different landscapes influence foraging decisions, and whether habitat alteration, such as that resulting from urbanization, influences broad-scale foraging activities of bees. This study evaluates the type and diversity of pollen collected by two solitary bees that are common in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the native Osmia pumila and the exotic O. caerulescens, sampled in trap nests set up in urban parks and gardens. We found that the dominant pollen in every successful brood cell was either of one widespread, cosmopolitan lawn-invasive plant species (Trifolium repens) or one of two wind-pollinated tree genera (Quercus spp. and Betula spp.). In combination, these three represented more than 90 % of all pollen collected by each bee species. Despite considerable overlap in the dominant pollen types collected by each bee species, the exotic O. caerulescens was significantly more specialized than the native O. pumila. Brood cells with Betula as the dominant pollen type were more pollen species-rich than those cells having Trifolium or Quercus as dominant, perhaps a result of the comparatively low protein content in Betula pollen.

T2  - Perspectives in Plant Ecology Evolution and Systematics
AB  - Urban land use strongly affects pollinators and plant pollination due to fragmentation and isolation of natural plant populations. On the other hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services. We related our results to both local and regional variables using Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

T2  - Journal of Entomological Science
AB  - Numbers of bumblebees (Hymenoptera Apidae) are decreasing in many European countries. Thirty-six species native to Poland are legally protected, and 19 are considered as threatened with extinction. A method for assessing the attractiveness of garden flowering plants for bumblebees was developed in this study. Observations were conducted through the growing seasons in 2011 and 2012 in two botanical gardens located in Wroclaw city, Poland. Bumblebees were observed and recorded on flowers during 30-min observations and determined to species level. An algorithm was used to define the attractiveness (Atp) of visited flowers, including the frequency of flower visits by bumblebees during phenological seasons. The resulting Atp values were assigned to a 4-level scale of attractiveness. In the botanical garden, the most "valuable'' plant species were Rhododendron catawbiense Michaux, Lathyrus vernus Bentham, Lathyrus odoratus L., Aristolochia clematitis L., Cyanus montanus Hill, Aconitum lycoctonum L., Hosta sp., Spiraea japonica L. filius, Lavandula 3 intermedia Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, and Lavandula angustifolia Miller; and in the Medicinal Plants Botanical Garden there were Geranium phaeum L., Agastache rugosa Kuntze, Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Cydonia oblonga Miller, R. catawbiense, Monarda didyma L., Aruncus dioicus Fernald, Lavandula angustifolia, Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham, Origanum vulgare L., and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. The proposed algorithm may be useful in protecting bumblebees, which takes into account their nutritional needs or feeding behavior. Careful plant selection in planning green urban areas with high rates of Atp will likely to contribute to an increase in numbers of bumblebees.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Over the next decades, green infrastructure initiatives such as tree planting campaigns, and ecological restoration will dramatically change the species composition, species distribution and structure of urban forests across the United States. These impending changes are accompanied by a demand for urban public spaces where people can engage in practices such as gleaning, gardening, and livestock production. This article analyzes the institutional framework that undergirds efforts in Seattle, Washington to normalize the production and use of edible landscapes. We focus attention on the role of grassroots fruit gleaning groups and highlight their bridging function between Seattle's agriculture and forestry policy arenas, creating an entry point for re-conceptualizing urban forests as sites of production. We conclude that a vision of urban forests as providers of goods as well as services may provide a more solid foundation for achieving urban sustainability than the current “hands off” approach to urban forest management. Gleaning and gathering in urban wild and cultivated landscapes provides opportunities for inhabitants to steward public natural resources and interact deeply with nature.

AU  - van Heezik, Yolanda M.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Very little little is known about how lizards respond to urbanization. Given their small space requirements, opportunist lizard species can potentially exist in small patches of suitable urban habitat. This study identified the relative importance of landscape and habitat-level factors that influenced the occurrence of an opportunist and generally abundant species, the common skink Oligosoma nigriplantare polychrome in suburban private gardens in New Zealand. Private gardens are potentially important in sustaining urban wildlife as they make up a significant proportion of the total area of many cities. Common skinks were largely absent from the central suburbs and distributed in less highly ordered gardens around the city edge. Skink occurrence was influenced mainly by landscape-level features that reflect opportunities for dispersal into gardens from source populations (distance to city edge; presence of an adjacent grassy paddock) and habitat quality (messiness). To a lesser extent skink occurrence was associated with lower cat densities, less native vegetation and south-facing sites. Within private gardens common skinks were associated with areas with a high proportion of basking surfaces, lower plant species diversity, shorter distances to potential cover, and vegetation that was low in height and made up mainly of long exotic grasses. Despite common skinks' ability to thrive in exotic vegetation and their small spatial requirements, it is unlikely that they will thrive in urban areas unless gardening practices change to increase resource availability and provide refuges from predators.

AU  - Mach, Bernadette M.
AU  - Potter, Daniel A.
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Urban and suburban landscapes can be refuges for biodiversity of bees and other pollinators. Public awareness of declining pollinator populations has increased interest in growing plants that provide floral resources for bees. Various publications and websites list "bee-friendly" plants, but such lists are rarely based on empirical data, nor do they emphasize flowering trees and shrubs, which are a major component of urban landscapes. We quantified bee visitation to 72 species of flowering woody landscape plants across 373 urban and suburban sites in Kentucky and southern Ohio, USA, sampling and identifying the bee assemblages associated with 45 of the most bee-attractive species. We found strong plant species effects and variation in seasonal activity of particular bee taxa, but no overall differences in extent of bee visitation or bee genus diversity between native and non-native species, trees and shrubs, or early-, mid-, and late-season blooming plants. Horticulturally-modified varieties of Hydrangea, Prunus, and Rosa with double petals or clusters of showy sterile sepals attracted few bees compared to related plants with more accessible floral rewards. Some of the non-native woody plant species bloomed when floral resources from native plants were scarce and were highly bee-attractive, so their use in landscapes could help extend the flowering season for bees. These data will help city foresters, landscape managers, and the public make informed decisions to create bee-friendly urban and suburban landscapes.

AB  - In mid 2003 a diverse floral resource was planted in a small urban residential plot at the University of California, Berkeley Oxford Tract with the goal of attracting local native California bee species to assess emerging patterns of diversity and seasonality. A standard procedure was then used in 2004 to sample the bees and monitor their host flowers. Pollen and nectar resources were abundant and consistently available during spring, summer, and early fall months of that year. Thirty-two bee species representing 17 genera, and five families used these resources through the 2004 season. Urban bees were categorized into three seasonalities early season, late season, and full season represented by seven, eight, and 17 species respectively. Results of this study indicate that newly-planted urban gardens, which are designed for bees, have the potential to attract diverse seasonal bee taxa if diverse floral resources are provided throughout the growing season. Implications of these finding are discussed in terms of managing and conserving local bees in new and more developed urban gardens. Long-term monitoring continues at this site.

AB  - Domestic gardens, as an important component of urban green infrastructure, could make significant contributions to urban biodiversity. This study evaluated species composition, floristic diversity, amenity-ecological characteristics, habitat condition, and performance of trees in domestic gardens in urban Hong Kong. The 1501 individual trees belonged to 72 species, 61 genera and 36 families, with domination by a small cohort of popular species. Tree composition skewed heavily toward exotic species count (81.9%) and tree count (91.1%). The most prominent amenity-ecological attributes were fast growth and establishment and interesting tree form and foliage, accounting respectively for 38, 32 and 27 species. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) indicated strong association between species distribution in domestic gardens and habitat-tree variables, such as tree density, tree aggregation, species aggregation, lots with trees and house lots. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed positive correlation (p < 0.05) between tree and species counts and lot frontage and garden depth. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) identified 16 species with relatively widespread presence in moderate or severe structural damage groups; and 22 species with very poor or poor overall condition. RDA further demonstrated positive correlation (p < 0.05) between structural damage and overall condition, and tree position and confinement type. The contribution of domestic gardens in the urban greening program could be improved with appropriate incentives, and be integrated into a comprehensive landscape plan. The management implications with reference to preservation and enhancement of garden trees could be applied to south China and other cities.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - The world's fast pace of urbanization has exerted profound pressure on urban trees. With over 400 years of urban history, Macau has developed an exceptionally high population density and ultra-compact mode, yet it permits survival of interesting and diverse heritage trees. These outstanding living remnants connote special values in history, ecology and botany. In conjunction with commemorative importance, they have been designated as Old and Precious Trees (OPT). This study evaluated the OPT with reference to (a) species diversity and evenness; (b) spatial distribution; (c) tree dimensions, age and health; and (d) spatial differentiation of tree attributes by four districts and eight tree-habitats. Heritage trees in Macau were compared with those in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The 793 OPT belong to 63 species. The exotic Ficus rumphii is overwhelmingly dominant, followed by F. microcarpa, Cinnamomum camphora and Dimocarpus longan. Species composition, age distribution and health conditions are associated with tree habitat. Roadside has the largest number of OPT but the least species richness. Public parks and gardens has the highest diversity and largest tree dimensions. The oldest trees are clustered in urban parks and religious places. Tree health is poorer at roadsides, and private residential and commercial properties. The patterns suggest close relationship between tree traits and physical fabric of the city. However, the variety rather than duration of geographical contacts is a key determinant of urban tree diversity. The findings offer insights for heritage-tree conservation and management strategies in compact cities with similar urban structure and history.

AB  - A mismatch of resource availability in certain periods can lead to spillover of insects between habitats, resulting in temporal differences in insect diversity. Urban gardens are important anthropogenic habitats but it is unknown whether, when and why spillover of beneficial insects occurs between gardens and agricultural habitats. We used trap nests for Hymenoptera to monthly monitor bee and wasp abundance and species richness in 12 gardens and 12 rapeseed fields. Half of the gardens and rapeseed fields were located in the urbanrural interface and bordered each other (a garden paired with a rapeseed field) and the other half were isolated in the rural landscape (isolated rapeseed fields) and in the urban city centre (isolated gardens). In general, gardens in the urbanrural interface comprised the highest richness of bees and wasps. The abundance of bees but not of wasps was highest in paired habitats and peaked at full rapeseed blooming, indicating that mass-flowering rapeseed offers foraging resources for bees nesting in adjacent gardens. Thus, bees nest and increase their populations in both areas, benefiting from the mass-flowering resource in the agricultural habitat as well as the nesting resources from gardens, suggesting spillover of bees but not of wasps between paired gardens and rapeseed fields. Our study highlights the value of gardens in the urbanrural interface for the biodiversity of functionally important insects. Implementing urban gardening and small-scale agriculture in cities and suburban habitats can promote local pollinator populations and benefit adjacent croplands

AB  - Data collected between 1987 and 2002 have been used to analyze the structure of small mammal communities in parks and public gardens of the city of Moscow. With regard to several ecological parameters, four categories of parks markedly differing in biotopic conditions have been distinguished. The least stable zoocenoses are formed in deteriorating parks. More favorable ecological conditions exist in public gardens and regular parks, where not only synanthropic but also hemisynanthropic rodents can be found. The fauna of small mammals in landscape parks is similar to that in forest cenoses, but this fauna in park forests better complies with the concept of forest community.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the major anthropogenic processes contributing to local habitat loss and extirpation of numerous species, including wild bees, the most widespread pollinators. Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.

AB  - 1. The invasion of alien plants into natural ecosystems in South Africa is a substantial conservation concern. The primary reason for the introduction of alien plants has been ornamental horticulture, and urban centres are the main sources of invasions. Small towns have high edge area ratios which favour the launching of invasions into surrounding areas. There is, however, a shortage of information at the global and local scale on the occun-ence, distribution, and status of alien plants in an urban context. 2. We surveyed all alien plants in the small town of Riebeek Kasteel in the Western Cape, South Africa, to gain insights on where to find alien plant species, and to assist with future studies and the management of alien floras in small towns. 3. We surveyed publically accessible land, recording the abundance of all alien plant species every 10 m of road. A species accumulation curve was compiled to show the rate at which new species were encountered. This approach was used to test the efficacy of different sampling strategies. 4. Two hundred and ninety eight alien plant taxa were recorded in five land-use types. Half of the alien plant species recorded were naturalised within the town, while a third were invasive in the region (the Berg River catchment). 95% of the taxa, including many invasive species, occurred in gardens or adjoining road-sides, highlighting the invasion risk posed by ornamental horticulture. The most efficient way of collecting data on alien plant distribution for this town would have been to survey roads in the town centre first, rather than urban-edge roads and industrial areas. 5. Synthesis and applications The gardens of small towns in South Africa harbour a high diversity of alien plants, many of which are already invasive or are potentially invasive. As the alien flora differs markedly between gardens, it is difficult to extrapolate generalised rules of thumb on where to survey. This means that compiling accurate inventories of alien plants in urban areas requires substantial search effort and taxonomic expertise.

AB  - Interest in urban vegetation has increased dramatically. Urban trees are an important aspect of the urban environment but there is little known about the potential sources of those trees, change in tree species diversity over time and the factors leading to the contemporary floristic composition in cities. We investigate tree nursery offerings in Los Angeles County over the past 110 years through the use of here-to-fore unexplored nursery catalogs to determine the diversity of trees that have been commercially available over time. Tree species information was collected spanning a 110-year study period and analyzed the data for four time periods (1900-1929, 1930-1959, 1960-1989, and 1990-2011). We found the number of genera and tree species offered significantly increased in the past 20 years (1990-2011). The numbers of non-native trees, angiosperms, and deciduous species all significantly increased with but no changes were observed in the numbers of native, evergreen, or gymnosperm species offered over this time period. The largest numbers of palm species were offered in 1900-1929. Overall there were 562 unique species offered belonging to 201 different genera in the 120-year study period, 48 species were California native trees and 514 of these were non-native species indicating that perhaps Los Angeles has one of the most diverse number of tree species offered for sale by the nursery industry.

T2  - Agroforestry Systems
AB  - In the recent decades, many studies have shown the important role of agroforestry, and particularly homegardens, in food supply, but few studies conducted in the Amazon include regional coverage and/or a large number of samples. This makes a more thorough assessment of the importance of these agroecosystems in agrobiodiversity conservation difficult. The objective of the present study is to assess the factors that determine the floristic composition and tree and palm diversity of homegardens at different spatial scales in the Central Amazon. 334 homegardens were sampled in rural and urban areas of 14 municipalities in the state of Para. Owners were interviewed for the collection of socioeconomic data. A total of 16,049 individual tree and palm were recorded, distributed in 108 species. Most species were fruit bearing. The correlations between socioeconomic and environmental factors and the floristic gradient established in each ordination were significant only at the local scale. Species richness was influenced by factors related to family income, homegarden size, and topographic environment. The criteria for selecting the species comprised in these homegardens are aimed at the food security of the families that own the homegardens. Thus, the floristic composition of homegardens in the Central Amazon is more strongly influenced by owners' decisions at a local level than by socioeconomic and environmental factors at broader scales. The importance of homegardens to food security and the autonomy of Amazon families indicate that public policies should be designed to stimulate more diverse production systems as a strategy to strengthen family agriculture and agrobiodiversity conservation in the Central Amazon.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - We investigated the relative importance of vacant lot and urban farm habitat features and their surrounding landscape context on bee community richness, abundance, composition, and resource use patterns. Three years of pan trap collections from 16 sites yielded a rich assemblage of bees from vacant lots and urban farms, with 98 species documented. We collected a greater bee abundance from vacant lots, and the two forms of greenspace supported significantly different bee communities. Plant-pollinator networks constructed from floral visitation observations revealed that, while the average number of bees utilizing available resources, niche breadth, and niche overlap were similar, the composition of floral resources and common foragers varied by habitat type. Finally, we found that the proportion of impervious surface and number of greenspace patches in the surrounding landscape strongly influenced bee assemblages. At a local scale (100 m radius), patch isolation appeared to limit colonization of vacant lots and urban farms. However, at a larger landscape scale (1000 m radius), increasing urbanization resulted in a greater concentration of bees utilizing vacant lots and urban farms, illustrating that maintaining greenspaces provides important habitat, even within highly developed landscapes.

T2  - Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment
AB  - We assessed bee diversity and abundance in a botanical garden in the city of Buenos Aires during two consecutive spring-summer periods. Every 15 days, we collected by hand-netting bee specimens seen foraging on flowers during five-minute censuses at every entomophilous herbaceous plant. A total of 66 bee species (Hymenoptera Apoidea) were recorded. Richness and abundance of native, generalist, and above-ground nesting (cavities) species were higher than that of exotic, specialist, and below-ground (soil) nesting ones, respectively. Social bees were more abundant, while the richness of solitary species was higher than that of social bees. Cleptoparasitic species were represented by a high number of species, even though only a few individuals were captured. Our results suggest that the studied area is an important bee reservoir within the city.

TI  - Wild bees and urban agriculture assessing pollinator supply and demand across urban landscapes
AU  - Zhao, Chang
AU  - Sander, Heather A.
AU  - Hendrix, Stephen D.
T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Growing interest in urban agriculture has increased demand for pollination services. Most studies map pollination supply broadly, and do not consider the impacts of fine-scale urban land-use practices on the dynamics of pollination delivery, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the pollinator supply-demand balance in urban landscapes. This study demonstrates a spatially-explicit framework, using Iowa City, IA (USA) as the case study region, for assessing the capacity of urban ecosystems to produce pollinator services in support of demand from urban agriculture. We estimate pollinator supply using the InVEST pollination model with detailed land-cover data produced through field survey and Bayesian hierarchical analysis, and we validate modeling results with bee abundance and richness data. We map social demand for pollinators using a kernel density estimation of urban agricultural sites and evaluate supply-demand budgets through spatial overlay analysis. Our results show that incorporating high-thematic-resolution urban land-use data substantially improves the performance of pollination supply modeling. Pollinator supply meets demand in 72% of the city. Surpluses occur in natural areas and heavily-vegetated, established residential neighborhoods, whereas deficits occur in resource-poor lawns. Our mapping framework stresses the key role of humans in modifying resource availability and pollinator services, and demonstrates the effectiveness of using disaggregated socio-economic data in urban land-cover classification for predicting pollinator supply. Our improved ability to identify spatial congruence and disparities in urban pollinator supply and demand can be used to inform pollinator conservation to support sustainable urban agriculture.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Urban biodiversity is essential to creating resilient and sustainable cities. Nevertheless, there is paucity of data on the characterization of microhabitat effects on species/trait diversity and diversity-functional relationships in urban landscapes especially in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to; 1) analyze tree species diversity and composition of urban green space (UGS) types and urban zones, (2) describe the life history diversity of UGS types and urban zones and 3) examine the links between species and life history trait diversity and species productivity (carbon storage) in Kumasi, Ghana. Stratified random sampling was adopted in surveying 470 sampling plots and six streets of lengths ranging from 50 m to 1 km. About 176 tree species in 46 families were recorded within Kumasi. About 96 species were in an adjacent natural forest located at the outskirts of the city. Home gardens, institutional compounds, and public parks had the highest species richness of 76, 75 and 71, respectively while urban rangelands and farmlands were the least species rich with 6 and 23, respectively. Species richness (S) in the peri-urban (LDUZ, S = 142) and core urban (HDUZ, S = 108) were significantly different (Χ2 = 15.7, p < 0.0001, n = 1). Native species richness was lowest in the core urban area and highest in the natural forest. Pioneers and anthropochory dispersed species were the most abundant, suggesting that this urban landscape is shaped by both environment and social filters. Tree species diversity and distribution depend on the type of UGS and portrays a perturbed landscape in the early seres of succession with the overall ecosystem function sustained by both species and life history trait diversities. The implications of these findings for improving urban biodiversity conservation and overall urban sustainability are discussed.

T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
AB  - Human-dominated landscapes represent one of the most rapidly expanding and least-understood ecosystems on earth. Yet, we know little about which features in these landscapes promote sustainable wildlife populations. Historically, in urban areas, landowners have converted native plant communities into habitats dominated by nonnative species that are not susceptible to pest damage and require little maintenance. However, nonnative plants are also poor at supporting insects that are critical food resources for higher order consumers. Despite the logical connection, no study has examined the impact of nonnative plants on subsequent population responses of vertebrate consumers. Here, we demonstrate that residential yards dominated by nonnative plants have lower arthropod abundance, forcing resident Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) to switch diets to less preferred prey and produce fewer young, or forgo reproduction in nonnative sites altogether. This leads to lower reproductive success and unsustainable population growth in these yards compared with those with >70% native plant biomass. Our results reveal that properties landscaped with nonnative plants function as population sinks for insectivorous birds. To promote sustainable food webs, urban planners and private landowners should prioritize native plant species.

AB  - Background A fast development of urban agriculture has recently taken place in many areas in the Republic of Benin. This study aims to assess the rapid expansion of urban agriculture especially, its contribution to the emergence of insecticide resistance in populations of Anopheles gambiae. Methods The protocol was based on the collection of sociological data by interviewing vegetable farmers regarding various agricultural practices and the types of pesticides used. Bioassay tests were performed to assess the susceptibility of malaria vectors to various agricultural insecticides and biochemical analysis were done to characterize molecular status of population of An. gambiae. Results This research showed that (1) The rapid development of urban agriculture is related to unemployment observed in cities, rural exodus and the search for a balanced diet by urban populations; (2) Urban agriculture increases the farmers' household income and their living standard; (3) At a molecular level, PCR revealed the presence of three sub-species of An. gambiae (An. gambiae s.s., Anopheles melas and Anopheles arabiensis) and two molecular forms (M and S). The kdr west mutation recorded in samples from the three sites and more specifically on the M forms seems to be one of the major resistance mechanisms found in An. gambiae from agricultural areas. Insecticide susceptibility tests conducted during this research revealed a clear pattern of resistance to permethrin (76% mortality rate at Parakou; 23.5% at Porto-Novo and 17% at Cotonou). Conclusion This study confirmed an increase activity of the vegetable farming in urban areas of Benin. This has led to the use of insecticide in an improper manner to control vegetable pests, thus exerting a huge selection pressure on mosquito larval population, which resulted to the emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors.

T2  - Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad
AB  - The diversity of anthropogenic spiders in the city of Chilpancingo, Guerrero, Mexico was studied using a systematized collection method in 4 sampling zones urban with a garden, urban without a garden, suburban, and rural. The total species richness was 63 morphospecies, 49 genera and 21 families. The family Theridiidae had the highest diversity (22 species). The total abundance of spiders was 4,120 individuals, with the highest abundance in the urban zone with a garden (1,163 individuals). The most abundant species were Physocyclus globosus (1,998 individuals) (Pholcidae), Oecobius navus (1,388) (Oecobidae), Nesticodes rufipes (313) (Theridiidae), Filistatoides sp.1 (83) (Filistatidae), and Dictynajacalana (52) (Dictynidae). The abundance of spiders found on the first story of the 16 sampled houses was higher than the abundance of spiders found on the second one. The morphospecies richness was higher for spiders from the first story than those from the second one and higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The highest diversity of spiders was found in the urban zone with a garden, both in the rainy and dry seasons. Based on the Morisita Horm index, the urban zone with a garden and the suburban zone were the most similar in terms of spider diversity. The species accumulation curves are still a useful tool to evaluate sampling quality and compare inventories of mega-diverse groups, such as spiders.

AB  - Urbanization negatively affects biodiversity by increasing disturbance and habitat fragmentation. We compared three different urban habitats (vacant lots, gardens and forests) to examine differences in spider communities. We selected four sites of each habitat type and sampled spiders with pitfall traps. We collected a total of 547 individuals from 19 families. The most common families were Lycosidae, Corinnidae, Liocranidae, Cybaeidae, and Dictynidae. Spider activity-density overall and for males and females was higher in vacant lots than in forests, and female spiders had greater activity-density in gardens than in forests. Observed species richness did not differ with habitat type. Spider family composition differed significantly between urban habitat types, female morphospecies composition differed in forests and gardens and male morphospecies composition differed in forests and lots. The site characteristics differed significantly with habitat, and these habitat differences explained a large fraction (53.3% to 90.9%) of the variation in composition and richness. Yet, bare ground was the only factor that significantly correlated with declines in female richness. Thus, spider communities, aspects of specifically activity-density and composition, differ between habitats in urban green spaces with potentially important implications for conservation and trophic interactions within urban areas.

AB  - Urbanization is a major threat to arthropod biodiversity and abundance due to reduction and loss of suitable natural habitat. Green spaces and small-scale agricultural areas may provide habitat and resources for arthropods within densely developed cities. We studied spider activity density ( a measure of both abundance and degree of movement) and diversity in urban gardens in Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and Monterey counties in central California, USA. We sampled for spiders with pitfall traps and sampled 38 local site characteristics for 5 mo in 19 garden sites to determine the relative importance of individual local factors. We also analyzed 16 landscape variables at 500-m and 1-km buffers surrounding each garden to determine the significance of landscape factors. We identified individuals from the most common families to species and identified individuals from other families to morphospecies. Species from the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae composed 81% of total adult spider individuals. Most of the significant factors that correlated with spider activity density and richness were local rather than landscape factors. Spider activity density and richness increased with mulch cover and flowering plant species, and decreased with bare soil. Thus, changes in local garden management have the potential to promote diversity of functionally important spiders in urban environments.

Sylvaemus sylvaticus appeared to be the most numerous and widely distributed species, the reproductive strategy of which consisted of intense reproduction in the summer. The second most abundant species was Microtus rossiaemeridionalis, which had a different reproductive strategy, with part of its population continuing to reproduce actively in the autumn. Urban woodlands are the most close to natural biotopes by the species composition. The highest number of animals was defined for meadows and gardens. No rodents and insectivores are found on lawns and waste grounds.

AB  - Approximately 35% of all crop production is dependent on animal-mediated pollination. Many wild bee species are declining rapidly across North America and Europe, a potential consequence of land-use change driven by agricultural intensification and urbanization. In this study we assessed the impact of urbanization on the reproductive success and population growth rate of bumblebees in an urbanization gradient. We placed experimental nests in ten sites; all except one were community gardens, ranging from a 0-99% degree of urbanization. Reproductive success and colony size were positively correlated with cumulative weight gain of the nests (p < 0.05). We did not find an effect of urbanization on the population growth rate of the nests or on forager activity (p > 0.05). Growth rate was strongly negatively affected by the abundance of wax moth larvae (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with parasite diversity (p < 0.05) and the number of foragers entering the nest (p < 0.01). With this study we show that not only bottom-up but also top-down effects are equally important for pollinator population dynamics.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - Although urbanization is increasing worldwide, relatively few studies have investigated patterns of urban biodiversity outside of city parks and reserves, in urban neighborhoods where people live and work. We evaluated models including local and landscape factors that might influence the bee and butterfly richness of community gardens located within densely populated neighborhoods of the Bronx and East Harlem in New York City (>10,000 people/km). The gardens were surrounded by buildings and limited amounts of green space (3,600-17,400 building units and 10-32% green space within a 500 m radius). Contrary to our initial prediction that landscape green space might be especially influential in this heavily urbanized setting, the most highly supported models for both bee and butterfly richness (based on Akaike Information Criterion) included just the local, within-garden variables of garden floral area and sunlight availability. There was marginal support for models of bee richness including the number of building units surrounding gardens within a 500 m radius (which exhibited a negative association with bee richness). In addition, perhaps because bees are central place foragers that may nest within or near gardens, supported models of bee species richness also included total garden area, canopy cover, and the presence of wild/unmanaged area in the garden. Generally, our findings indicate that sunlight and floral abundance are the major factors limiting local pollinator diversity in this setting. This suggests that rooftop and other open urban habitats might be managed to increase local pollinator diversity, even if seemingly isolated within heavily developed neighborhoods

AB  - The apparent reduction of solitary and primitively eusocial bees populations has remained a huge concern over the past few decades and urbanisation is considered as one of the factors affecting bees at different scales depending on bee guild. As urbanisation is increasing globally it necessitates more research to understand the complex community dynamics of solitary and primitively eusocial bees in urban settings. We investigated the urban core of a British town for diversity and abundance of solitary bees using standardized methods, and compared the results with nearby meadows and nature reserves. The study recorded 48 species within the town, about 22 % of the total species and 58 % of the genera of solitary bees in the United Kingdom. Furthermore we found the urban core to be more diverse and abundant in solitary and primitively eusocial bees compared to the meadows and nature reserves. Of particular note was an urban record of the nationally rare Red Data Book species Coelioxys quadridentata and its host Anthophora quadrimaculata. This research demonstrates that urban settings can contribute significantly to the conservation of solitary and primitively eusocial bees in Britain.

AB  - Urbanization requires the conversion of natural land cover to cover with human-constructed elements and is considered a major threat to biodiversity. Bee populations, globally, are under threat; however, the effect of rapid urban expansion in Southeast Asia on bee diversity has not been investigated. Given the pressing issues of bee conservation and urbanization in Southeast Asia, coupled with complex factors surrounding human-bee coexistence, we investigated bee diversity and human perceptions of bees in four megacities. We sampled bees and conducted questionnaires at three different site types in each megacity a botanical garden, central business district, and peripheral suburban areas. Overall, the mean species richness and abundance of bees were significantly higher in peripheral suburban areas than central business districts; however, there were no significant differences in the mean species richness and abundance between botanical gardens and peripheral suburban areas or botanical gardens and central business districts. Urban residents were unlikely to have seen bees but agreed that bees have a right to exist in their natural environment. Residents who did notice and interact with bees, even though being stung, were more likely to have positive opinions towards the presence of bees in cities.

TI  - The bees among us: Modelling occupancy of solitary bees
AU  - MacIvor, J. Scott
AU  - Packer, Laurence
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Occupancy modelling has received increasing attention as a tool for differentiating between true absence and non-detection in biodiversity data. This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species [Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.), Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea Megachilidae) being present when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M. centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O. pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O. caerulescens being highest in community gardens. The combination of occupancy modelling with analysis of habitat variables as an augmentation to detection and abundance-based sampling is suggested to be the best way to ensure that urban habitat management results in the desired outcomes.

AB  - Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant urban green space habitats (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3) front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants. Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes.

AB  - Philadelphus coronarius - Aphis fabae cirsiiacanthoidis Scop. - aphidiid parasitoid associations are reviewed on grounds of long-term samples taken in Czechoslovakia. The results are compared with those obtained in a model area where the effect of habitat overlapping was studied and the information is compared with results from other parts of Europe (Poland, France - references). The aphid is classified as a beneficial species both in urban (parks, gardens, waste places) and field environments as its populations represent an important reservoir of prey/host of natural enemies (predators, parasitoids) of several aphid pests on crops. Aphis sambuci L. (Sambucus nigra) and Aphis spiraephaga Mull. have the same status from the Integrated Pest Management point of view.

T2  - Journal of Medical Entomology
AB  - The urban area of Dakar, Senegal, contains >5,000 market-garden wells that provide permanent sites for mosquito larvae, in particular Anopheles arabiensis Patton, the major vector of malaria. A study of the bioecology of mosquito larvae was conducted over 1 yr with a monthly visit to 48 of these wells. Overall, 9,589 larvae were collected of which 80.1% were Culicinae and 11.9% Anophelinae. Larvae from stages III and IV (n = 853) were identified to 10 species. An. arabiensis represented 86% of the anophelines collected and An. ziemanni Grunberg 14%. The most common Culicinae species included Aedeomyia africana Neveu-Lemaire, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Mimomyia splendens Theobald. Maximum anopheline abundance was observed at the end of the dry season in June, whereas maximum Culicinae abundance was observed at the end of the rainy season in September. Most wells (67%) did not harbor any An. arabiensis larvae and in the remaining 33% the larval abundance was low, averaging 0.54 larvae in stages III-IV per tray sample. To identify factors that determine the abundance of larvae in these wells, a co-inertia (multivariate) analysis was carried out to account for physicochemical variables (depth, turbidity, temperature, pi-i, conductivity, Na+, Cl-, HCO3-, CO3--, and NO3- concentrations) and biological variables (abundance of mosquito species, predators [e.g., fish, Dytiscidae, Notonectidae, odonates ], molluscs [Bulinus and Biomphalaria], and surface plants [water lettuce, Lemna, and flamentous algae]). The co-inertia analysis indicated that the abundance of An. arabiensis was associated with Cr, quinquefasciatus and Cx. decens for the physiochemical data but was not associated with other mosquito species for floro-faunistic data. The conditions associated with abundant An. arabiensis were warm temperature (28 - 30 degrees C), clear and not too deep water (<0.5 m), elevated concentrations of HCO3- and CO3--, low concentrations of NO3- and NaCl low populations of larvivorous fish and invertebrate predators (notably odonates), the presence of water lettuce, and an absence of Lemna. These results indicate that many contributing factors influence the ecology of the immature stages of An. arabiensis.

AB  - Urban agriculture is common across Africa and contributes to the livelihoods of urban dwellers. Some crop systems create suitable mosquito breeding sites and thus might affect malaria transmission. The purpose of this study was to identify, map, and characterize potential mosquito breeding sites in agricultural land use zones in a medium-sized town of western C (o) over cap te d'lvoire and to assess risk factors for productive Anopheles breeding sites. Two surveys were carried out; one toward the end of the rainy season and the second one during the dry season. In all identified potential mosquito breeding sites, two experienced entomologists searched for the presence of Anopheles larvae and pupae with a standardized technique. Totals of 369 and 589 sites were found in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively, mainly in vegetable gardens and irrigated rice fields. Anopheles larvae were present in 50.7% and 42.4% of the sites investigated during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Typical Anopheles larval habitats were characterized by the presence of algae, the absence of floating vegetation, and the co-occurrence of Culex larvae. The highest Anopheles larval productivity was observed in rice paddies, agricultural trenches between vegetable patches, and irrigation wells. An indirect link could be established between the occurrence of productive Anopheles breeding sites and agricultural land use through specific man-made habitats, in particular agricultural trenches, irrigation wells, and rice paddies. Our findings have important bearings for the epiderniology and control of urban malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Domestic gardens associated with residential zones form a major component of vegetated land in towns and cities. Such gardens may play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in urban areas, but variation in the abundance of organisms in gardens has been little explored. We report the results from a case study of 61 domestic gardens in the city of Sheffield, UK. Across 22 invertebrate groups, the median number of individuals recorded per garden was 49, 178, and 1012 in litter collections, pitfall and Malaise trap samples, respectively. Abundance was analysed by stepwise multiple regression and hierarchical tree analysis in relation to garden and landscape variables. The amount of variation explained in regression models ranged from 4 to 56%, for data based on pitfall and litter samples, and from 16 to 92% for data from Malaise traps. In total, 31 out of 36 explanatory variables entered into stepwise regression models, and 29 of them did so more than once. Although there was strong evidence only for approximately half of such relationships, in these cases the two methods of analysis corroborated one another. General correlates of invertebrate abundance were lacking, and likely reasons for inconsistencies in the relationships are discussed in the context of sampling and species biology. Correlates of the greatest significance occurred at both landscape (e.g. altitude) and garden scales (e.g. area of canopy vegetation). These factors were associated with species richness as well as abundance.

AB  - Beginning around 1800, but primarily since the early and mid-twentieth century, the giant African snail, Achatina (Lissachatina) fulica Bowdich, 1822, has been introduced throughout the tropics and subtropics and has been considered the most important snail pest in these regions. In Brasil, specimens probably brought from Indonesia were introduced into the state of Parana in the 1980s for commercial purposes ("escargot" farming) that were not successful. Achatina fulica is now widespread in at least 23 out of 26 Brasilian states and the Federal District, including the Amazonian region and natural reserves. Among the reasons for the species' rapid invasion are its high reproductive capacity and the tendency for people to release the snails into the wild. Achatina fulica occurs in dense populations in urban areas where it is a pest in ornamental gardens, vegetable gardens, and small-scale agriculture. Also of concern is the damage caused to the environment, and potential competition with native terrestrial mollusks. It can also act as an intermediate host of Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode that can cause meningoencephalitis in people, and it may be a potential host of A. costaricensis, which causes abdominal angiostrongylosis, a zoonosis that occurs from the southern United States to northern Argentina. Management and control measures for A. fulica are under way in Brasil through a national plan implemented by the Brasilian government.

AB  - Immatures of both Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have been found in water-holding bromeliad axils in Brazil. Removal of these plants or their treatment with insecticides in public and private gardens have been undertaken during dengue outbreaks in Brazil despite uncertainty as to their importance as productive habitats for dengue vectors. From March 2005-February 2006, we sampled 120 randomly selected bromeliads belonging to 10 species in a public garden less than 200 m from houses in a dengue-endemic neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro. A total of 2,816 mosquito larvae and pupae was collected, with an average of 5.87 immatures per plant per collection. Culex (Microculex) pleuristriatus and Culex spp of the Ocellatus Group were the most abundant culicid species, found in all species of bromeliads; next in relative abundance were species of the genus Wyeomyia. Only two individuals of Ae. aegypti (0.07%) and five of Ae. albopictus (0.18%) were collected from bromeliads. By contrast, immatures of Ae. aegypti were found in manmade containers in nearly 5% of nearby houses. These results demonstrate that bromeliads are not important producers of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and, hence, should not be a focus for dengue control. However, the results of this study of only one year in a single area may not represent outcomes in other urban localities where bromeliads, Ae. aegypti and dengue coincide in more disturbed habitats.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - We investigate here invertebrate response to alien pine plantations, their removal in comparison with natural vegetation, recovering indigenous forests and a botanical garden around Cape Town, South Africa, within a biodiversity hotspot. Pines had low invertebrate species richness and abundance. The botanical garden had the highest species richness and abundance. Natural fynbos vegetation was more similar to pines than to recovering fynbos, while recovering forest was more similar to pines than to any other site. The botanical garden is a major refugium for invertebrate species. Surprisingly, invertebrate assemblages in natural fynbos were more similar to those in pines than in recovering fynbos after the removal of pines. This suggests that some invertebrate species colonize the fynbos soon after rehabilitation disturbance, a response similar to the influence of fire. However, it takes longer for other natural climax invertebrate species to establish, some of which find refuge in pines and the botanical garden. Invertebrate assemblages of indigenous natural forests are more difficult to restore than those of fynbos, thus the protection of the remaining natural forests is a conservation priority. Invasive alien Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) was far more abundant in recovering fynbos than in natural fynbos or in the botanical garden and pines. It benefits from initial restoration disturbance, although is likely to decline as the natural fynbos mature. This study strongly supports removal of alien pines in an urban context, and also emphasizes that an urban botanical garden of indigenous plants has major invertebrate conservation value.

T2  - Insect Conservation and Diversity
AB  - 1. Despite increasing interest in gardening for wildlife, experiments testing the conservation value of garden alterations are scarce, particularly in heavily urbanised landscapes. 2. In this paper, we assess the ability of discrete additions of native wildflowers (70 plants of seven plant species added and subsequently monitored for 2 years) to augment species richness of beneficial insects including bees, butterflies and predatory wasps in New York City community gardens. We also evaluate the overall use of native and introduced flowers by these insect groups in the urban garden study sites. 3. Bayesian analyses failed to find a strong influence of the native plant additions on beneficial insect richness, after correcting for prior floral abundance. 4. In addition, butterflies and megachilid (leaf-cutter) bees were found to heavily utilise introduced ornamental and crop flowers in these gardens, even when native flowers were present. 5. Our results suggest that exotic garden plants are utilised by, and important in maintaining richness of, beneficial insects in urbanised landscapes. Furthermore, garden manipulations need to be more substantial than often recommended, if they are to significantly influence the richness of beneficial insects in urban gardens.

AU  - Peralta, Guadalupe

T2  - Ecological Entomology
AB  - 1. Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence. 2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species. 3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack. 4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leafminer abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements. 5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants. Parasitism may be affected by distance from the corridor rather than physical barriers or other potential hosts.

An experiment with congeneric plant pairs and diverse above- and below-ground enemies. Ecology, 86, 29792989) proposed that areas or times in which damage to introduced species is low provide opportunities for the invasion of native habitat. We tested whether ornamental settings may provide areas with low levels of herbivory for trees and shrubs, potentially facilitating invasion success. First, we compared levels of leaf herbivory among native and exotic species in ornamental and natural settings in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. In the second study, we compared levels of herbivory for invasive and noninvasive exotic species between natural and ornamental settings. We found lower levels of leaf damage for exotic species than for native species; however, we found no differences in the amount of leaf damage suffered in ornamental or natural settings. Our results do not provide any evidence that ornamental settings afford additional release from herbivory for exotic plant species.

AU  - Clergeau, Philippe
T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Ecological corridors are landscape elements that prevent the negative effects of fragmentation. However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes. We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition. For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids. The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens. Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities.

AB  - The main objective of this research was to test Chilean native plants under green roof conditions using an appropriate substrate of local origin. Sixteen native species from the Mediterranean region of the country were chosen and grouped into four landscape groups (three adapted to full sun and one to partial shade) and planted under green roof simulation inside the urban area of Santiago. Two different substrate mixes and 9 cm of depth were used to grow the four landscape groups. As a control, replicates of each association were grown under garden situation in the same location and without soil depth limitations. The parameters analyzed were percentage of survival, aerial growth, rate of coverage, time of flowering, competitiveness ability against weeds as well as maintenance cost and quantity of water required. During the first growing season was possible to observe that weed pressure was 8 times less than in the garden controls. In the full sun association Glandularia berteri has performed exceptionally presenting frost resistance and early and extended blooming. Also in that association Geum magellanicum performed above the average. In the partial shade association Cotula scariosa has shown a fast growth and frost resistance and the larger coverage rate. In general, the four plant groups shown to be suitable to be grown under green roof conditions with the exception of Plumbago coerulea that was not frost resistant. Future evaluations will be performed at least for another two growing seasons

AB  - To select plant species and species combinations for northern climates, mats with different plant species and species combinations were constructed on a green roof plant production farm and later transported and installed on an urban rooftop. There were three treatments two different planting combinations, which together consisted of 10 diverse plant species [both stonecrop (Sedum) species and nonstonecrop species], and a control, which consisted of 26 stonecrop species used for standard mat production. Growth measurements and observations were made at both sites and special attention was paid to the performance of species during the harvest, transportation, and installation stages, as well as during recovery postinstallation. All species but false rock cress (Aubrieta cultorum) were found to be suitable for extensive green roof applications in northern climates, although there were variations of suitability among the species. Good, mediocre, and poor interactions formed between numerous species, displaying different levels of compatibility. Finally, all species were considered appropriate for a mat production system; species that failed to germinate, species planted postinstallation, the frequently displaced rolling hens and chicks (Jovibarba sobolifera), and false rock cress were exceptions. Overall, many species in this study displayed successful, well-rounded growth. Based on results, species and species combinations were recommended for extensive green roofs in northern climates.

AB  - Buildings structures and surfaces are explicitly being used to grow plants, and these "urban plantings" are generally designed for aesthetic value. Urban plantings also have the potential to contribute significant "ecological values" by increasing urban habitat for animals such as arthropods and by increasing plant productivity. In this study, we evaluated how the provision of these additional ecological values is affected by plant species richness; the availability of essential resources for plants, such as water, light, space; and soil characteristics. We sampled 33 plantings located on the exterior of three buildings in the urban center of Brisbane, Australia (subtropical climatic region) over 2, 6 week sampling periods characterized by different temperature and rainfall conditions. Plant cover was estimated as a surrogate for productivity as destructive sampling of biomass was not possible. We measured weekly light levels (photosynthetically active radiation), plant CO2 assimilation, soil CO2 efflux, and arthropod diversity. Differences in plant cover were best explained by a three-way interaction of plant species richness, management water regime and sampling period. As the richness of plant species increased in a planter, productivity and total arthropod richness also increased significantly likely due to greater habitat heterogeneity and quality. Overall we found urban plantings can provide additional ecological values if essential resources are maintained within a planter such as water, light and soil temperature. Diverse urban plantings that are managed with these principles in mind can contribute to the attraction of diverse arthropod communities, and lead to increased plant productivity within a dense urban context.

AB  - Changes to the ground layer in urban areas are extensive, but the effects on arthropod fauna are poorly understood. We undertook a manipulative experiment to examine the response of arthropods to small-scale variation in ground covers commonly found in urban parks and gardens in Australia. The ground covers tested were bare ground, leaf litter, woodchips and grass, with plot sizes of 3.6 m(2). Epigeic arthropods were sampled with pitfall traps and Tullgren funnels over 12 months following establishment of the treatments. All epigeic arthropods were sorted to order and the ants (Hymenoptera Formicidae), beetles (Coleoptera), millipedes (Diplopoda) and slaters (Isopoda Oniscidea) were examined at lower taxonomic levels. Diverse arthropods rapidly colonised previously cleared plots in all four treatments and were most abundant in grass plots. The diversity of ants and beetles was significantly different in different ground covers and tended to be most diverse in grass plots. Despite the treatments providing very different microclimates, the fauna studied did not show strong selection for a particular cover type overall. The abundance of grass cover in the surrounding area may have led to the grass plots having the greatest abundance of arthropods. These results have important implications for developing effective small-scale conservation efforts for arthropods in anthropogenically modified landscapes, especially for species with poor dispersal abilities.

AB  - The present work, focusing on the theme of food
production and consumption in urban areas, analyses the
relationships among three factors: city, human well-being
and ecosystems. A case study was carried out addressing the
quantification of the potential of rooftop vegetable production
in the city of Bologna (Italy) as related to its citizens’ needs.
Besides the contribution to food security of the city, the
potential benefits to urban biodiversity and ecosystem service
provision were estimated. The methodology consisted of: 1)
experimental trials of potential productivity of simplified soilless
systems in rooftop gardens (RTGs); 2) detection of all flat
roofs and roof-terraces and quantification of the potential
surfaces that could be converted into RTGs; 3) identification
of the city’s vegetable requirements, based on population and
diet data; 4) calculation of the proportion of vegetable requirement
that could be satisfied by local RTG production; 5)
identification of other benefits (improvement of urban biodiversity
through the creation of green corridors and estimation
of carbon sequestration) associated with the increased area of
urban green infrastructure (GI). According to the present
study, RTGs could provide more than 12,000 t year−1 vegetables
to Bologna, satisfying 77 % of the inhabitants’ requirements.
The study also advances hypotheses for the implementation of biodiversity roofs enabling the connection
of biodiversity rich areas across and close to the city: these
would form a network of green corridors of over 94 kmlength
with a density of about 0.67 km km−2.

AB  - Urban green spaces, such as forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens, are increasingly highlighted as biodiversity refuges and are of growing interest to conservation. At the same time, the burgeoning urban garden movement partially seeks to ameliorate problems of food security. Arthropods link these two issues (conservation and food security) given their abundance, diversity, and role as providers of ecosystem services like pollination and pest control. Many previous studies of urban arthropods focused on a single taxon (e.g. order or family), and examined either local habitat drivers or effects of landscape characteristics. In contrast, we examined both local and landscape drivers of community patterns, and examined differences in abundance, richness, and trophic structure of arthropod communities in urban forest fragments, vacant lots, and community gardens. We sampled ground-foraging arthropods, collected data on 24 local habitat features (e.g., vegetation, ground cover, concrete), and examined land-cover types within 2 km of 12 study sites in Toledo, Ohio. We found that abundance and richness of urban arthropods differed by habitat type and that richness of ants and spiders, in particular, varied among lots, gardens, and forests. Several local and landscape factors correlated with changes in abundance, richness, and trophic composition of arthropods, and different factors were important for specific arthropod groups. Overwhelmingly, local factors were the predominant (80 % of interactions) driver of arthropods in this urban environment. These results indicate that park managers and gardeners alike may be able to manage forests and gardens to promote biodiversity of desired organisms and potentially improve ecosystem services within the urban landscape.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Interest in reducing carbon emissions and carbon trading programs has been increasing. In order to calculate the carbon benefits of landscapes, we must first understand how they sequester and store carbon. Carbon dynamics have been extensively studied in natural and agricultural landscapes, and urban and community forests. Relatively little is known about carbon sequestration in ornamental landscapes. This study compared the carbon content of nine in ground and three green roof landscape systems of varying complexity to determine their carbon sequestration potential. Soil or substrate samples were analyzed prior to planting in 2009 and soil/substrate, below- and above-ground biomass were analyzed at the end of the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Landscape systems containing more woody plants, such shrubs (65.67, 78.75, and 62.91 kg m(-2)) and herbaceous perennials and grasses (68.75 and 67.70 kg m(-2) for the in-ground and green roofs, respectively) had higher carbon content than other landscape systems. The native prairie mix (28.57 kg m(-2)) also had high carbon content, because of the high volume of plant biomass. The vegetable and herb garden and vegetable green roof contained a moderate amount of carbon (54.18 and 11.03 kg m(-2), respectively). The Sedum and prairie green roofs contained less carbon than their counterpart in-ground landscape systems, suggesting that although green roofs do sequester a small amount of carbon, greater benefit can be achieved in ground level landscape systems. Ornamental landscapes have good potential for carbon sequestration but management practices can affect their net carbon sequestration and the permanence of the carbon sequestered.

T2  - Biodiversity and Conservation
AB  - Insect diversity may be declining even more rapidly than in plants and vertebrates, particularly in areas where indigenous habitats are replaced by an anthropogenic one. The most common component of anthropogenic greenspace is the ornamental lawn. Intensively managed and offering limited habitat opportunities for both plants and insects, lawns are biodiversity poor and ecologically insensitive. An alternative lawn format that positively influences biodiversity and reduces management requirements would be a useful tool in eco-friendly urban greenspace management. In investigating the potential for a forb-only alternative to the grass lawn we sampled both trial grassfree lawn formats and turf lawns to identify any influence that lawn composition and grass-free lawn specific mowing regimes might have on the abundance and diversity of insect families. In addition to the mowing regimes, both the composition and origin of lawn flora were found to significantly influence insect abundance and diversity and these factors rarely interacted. Native-only and mixed origin grass-free lawns hosted greater numbers of adult insects than found in turf and an equivalent diversity of insect families, however the mowing regime applied was distinct from traditional turf lawn management by being substantially less intensive and our results suggest that there is the potential for even greater abundance and diversity via the grass-free format that may offer additional resources to insectivorous garden species such as birds. When the composition of grass-free lawns included native forbs the diversity of insect families was found be sufficiently different from turf lawns to form distinct assemblages and in so doing contribute to beta diversity within urban greenspace. In sum, grass-free lawns may be a useful and aesthetically appropriate tool for adding value to the generally biodiversity poor urban lawnscape.

AB  - Thygater aethiops is a native bee that can be found in parks and gardens in diverse urban areas such as those in the city of Bogota (Colombia). However, little is known about its biology as well as ecological adaptations to urban areas. This study aimed to describe the seasonal cycle and daily foraging activities of T. aethiops, as well as identify the pollen resources used by this bee over a year in a population nesting in an aggregation in the "Parque Nacional Enrique Olaya Herrera" in Bogota. Changes in the nest activity were monitored weekly by counting the number of active nests in the aggregation between December/2012 and February/2014. To determine the daily foraging activity, the numbers of bees entering their nests over a period of 10 minutes every hour between 8 00 and 14 00 h were recorded. Females with pollen loads entering to their nest were captured weekly, between September/2012 and August/2013, and their pollen loads analyzed. Three nesting peaks occurred after the precipitation peaks, but the number of active nests was not correlated with precipitation. The nesting activities stopped in a large number of the active nests (20-50 % of nests) after an anthropic disturbance was registered in the nesting area. Bees forage for nectar and pollen between 8 00 and 14 00 h, with a peak at 10 00 h. Daily foraging activity changed during the study period due to anthropic disturbance. There was not a significant relationship between air temperature and the number of females entering their nests. Foraging activities did not change between the dry and rainy seasons. A total of 26 pollen types were found in 169 pollen loads. Ulex europaeus (Fabaceae) and Solanum laxum (Solanaceae) were the most abundant plants represented on the pollen load across the study period. According to these results, T. aethiops would be considered a mesolectic species. The ability of T. aethiops to use different pollen resources both native and exotic, as well as to presumably recover its population after disturbances, are characteristics that may have allowed this bee to adapt to urban environments. Knowledge on the floral resources as well as other biological features of this bee species is important to promote its conservation in urban areas.

AB  - Private gardens comprise a large proportion of urban green space and can contain diverse and structurally complex vegetation, typically dominated by exotic species, but potentially providing resources for a diverse invertebrate fauna. We determined how much beetle diversity and community structure were influenced by vegetation composition and structure, native vegetation, garden land covers, and proximity and extent of neighbourhood green spaces in 55 gardens in Dunedin, New Zealand. We recorded 164 species from 29 families after 10 days of pitfall trapping; 68% native, 15% exotic. Beetle diversity exceeded that reported in other less modified New Zealand habitats, possibly due to high habitat heterogeneity at the scale of the garden but also the variety of habitats present at a larger scale but separated by relatively short distances within this small, city and across a short altitudinal gradient, from sea level to sub -alpine environments. Number of shrubs (2-5 m), woody plant density, and area of lawn and hedge influenced beetle richness, diversity and community structure, but explained <30% of variation between gardens. We found no effect of mean diversity of herbaceous vegetation in bed use, mowing and composting on diversity or community structure. Proximity to green space, woody plant diversity and vegetation structural complexity influenced beetle community composition, but correlations were weak. Although only 17% of all woody plants were native, most beetle species were native. With the exception of gardens that had very little vegetation, landscaping choices appeared to have little effect on beetle diversity and assemblage composition.

T2  - Ecological Research
AB  - Urbanization and agriculture cause alterations in soil biodiversity. As arthropods quickly respond to soil changes, they have been recognized as good indicators of soil quality. This study aimed to evaluate if (1) soil physico-chemical properties act as environmental filters of the functional trait distribution of soil arthropod community; (2) the abundance of certain functional traits is linked to different land uses; (3) the taxonomical and functional approaches provide complementary information about the evaluation of biological soil quality. The study was performed at forest, agricultural and urban sites in downtown and surroundings of Naples. The soils were characterized for texture, pH, organic matter content, water content, total Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations. The forest soils showed the highest organic matter and water contents, and the lowest metal concentrations; the agricultural soils showed the lowest organic matter and water contents and high Cd and Cu concentrations, whereas the urban soils showed high Pb and Zn concentrations. The forest soils showed the highest arthropod density, taxa richness and diversity. The distribution of the functional traits in the arthropod communities of the different land uses highlighted similarity only for the preference to occupy soil and for the percentage contribution of detritivores. The abundance of arthropods living above litter and omnivores were positively correlated to Pb and Zn concentrations, whereas predators were positively correlated to Cu concentrations. The findings suggest that the arthropod identification at order level could be enough to detect differences in functional traits among forest, urban, and agricultural soils.

AB  - Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic-and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic-and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities.

AB  - BACKGROUND Anopheles vectors of malaria are supposedly less common in urban areas as a result of pollution, but there is increasing evidence of their adaptation to organically polluted water bodies. This study characterized the breeding habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes in the two major urban areas in southern Ghana; Accra (AMA) and Sekondi-Takoradi (STMA) Metropolitan Areas, during dry and wet seasons. METHODS Anopheles mosquito larvae were sampled using standard dipping methods to determine larval densities. The origin, nature and stability of 21 randomly selected sites were observed and recorded. Mosquito larvae were reared to adults and Anopheles species identified by both morphological and molecular means. RESULTS Sixty-six percent of Anopheles habitats were permanent and 34% temporal, and 74.5% man-made while 25.5% were natural. Puddles and urban farm sites accounted for over 51% of all Anopheles mosquitoes sampled. The mean larval densities among the habitat types was highest of 13.7/dip for puddles and lowest of 2.3/dip for stream/river, and the variation between densities were significant (P=0.002). The mean larval densities were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season for the two study areas combined (P=0.0191) and AMA (P=0.0228). Over 99% of the 5,802 morphologically identified Anopheles species were An. gambiae (s.l.) of which more than 99% of the studied 898 were An. coluzzii (62%) and An. gambiae (s.s.) (34%). Urban farms, puddles, swamps and ditches/ dugouts accounted for approximately 70% of all An. coluzzii identified. Conversely, drains, construction sites, streams/rivers and others contributed 80% of all An. gambiae (s.s.) sampled. The wet season had significantly higher proportion of Anopheles larvae compared to the dry season (Z=8.3683, P<0.0001). Also, the proportion of Anopheles mosquitoes produced by permanent breeding sites was 61.3% and that of temporary sites was 38.7%. CONCLUSION Taken together, the data suggest that man-made and/ or permanent habitats were the main contributors to Anopheles larval populations in the cities and that regulation of the anthropogenic processes that lead to development of breeding places and proper environmental management can drastically reduce mosquito breeding sites in urban areas of Ghana

AB  - The invasive and predatory harlequin lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, has been introduced as a biological control agent to many agricultural areas worldwide and has now spread from agricultural to natural habitats where it threatens native arthropod biodiversity. The aim of this study was to determine how H. axyridis uses the local landscape during different times of the year in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. We also determined its association to native arthropod diversity. Harmonia axyridis adults and larvae, as well as arthropod herbivores, predators and other ladybeetles were sampled every second month for a year with a vacuum sampler in vineyards, natural habitats, edges between natural habitats and vineyards, and urban areas. Highest adult and larval H. axyridis abundance occurred in urban areas during all sampling periods, with a peak in May and July (winter). Vineyards and natural vegetation had very low abundances of H. axyridis. Harmonia axyridis had some, but limited effect on the local arthropod community abundance. There was also a negative relationship between H. axyridis and the overall arthropod community as well as a positive relationship between H. axyridis abundance and that of other ladybeetles. Harmonia axyridis appeared to influence the assemblage composition of other ladybeetles and herbivores. Overall, the native arthropod assemblage responded primarily to season and habitat and secondary to the presence of H. axyridis. Harmonia axyridis has a strong association with the urban environment, seemingly in association with the exotic aphid Tuberculatus annulatus that feeds on cultivated oak trees. Outside of the urban area, H. axyridis numbers were very low and its ecological impacts may be negligible.

AB  - Domestic gardens, typically consisting of a mixture of native and non-native plants, support biodiversity. The relative value of these native and non-native plants for invertebrates is largely unknown. To address this a replicated field experiment with plots planted with one of three assemblages of non-invasive perennial and shrubby garden plants (treatments), based on plant origin [UK native, near-native (Northern Hemisphere) and Exotic (Southern Hemisphere)] was established. Over 4 years the invertebrates were recorded by Vortis suction sampler and amount of plant material measured. The abundance of above ground plant-inhabiting invertebrates increased with canopy cover and was higher on the native treatment. For several functional groups including herbivores and some predatory groups the near-native plants supported only marginally fewer individuals compared to native plots, with exotic plants being less favoured. The experiment demonstrated that gardens and other cultivated ornamental plantings support a wide range of plant-inhabiting invertebrates from primary functional groups regardless of the plants' origin and the more plant matter (canopy cover) available the greater the abundance. Greater abundance of invertebrates will be supported by gardens and cultivated planting schemes with plantings biased towards native and near-native plants and that provide dense vegetation cover. However, exotic plants should not be dismissed as these are inhabited by some invertebrates.

AB  - In May 2016, we collected ants at 16 sites in the city of Tangier, Morocco, primarily in urban gardens and parks. We found a total of 38 ant species, including eight non-native tramp species, Cardiocondyla emeryi, Linepithema humile, Nylanderia jaegerskioeldi, Paratrechina longicornis, Pheidole megacephala, Strumigenys membranifera, Tetramorium bicarinatum, and Tetramorium caldarium. These eight plus Monomorium pharaonis represent all non-native ant species known from Morocco. Two of these species are not been previously known from Morocco N. jaegerskioeldi and P. megacephala. We found N. jaegerskioeldi at five sites, suggesting that this previously unreported species may have an expanding population in Morocco. We found P. megacephala in a single park in Tangier. Competition with native Pheidole species may limit the spread of P. megacephala in Morocco. The only tramp species from the New World known from Morocco is the Argentine ant, L. humile, which we collected at 7 sites. This species, originally from South America, is an important ecological and agricultural pest in areas with Mediterranean-like climates, including not only the Mediterranean region, but also southern California, southern Africa, and southern Australia.

AU  - Walton, Kerry
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Zoology
AB  - Hygromia cinctella is a medium-sized, pulmonate land snail native to the Mediterranean region and is undergoing rapid range expansion in Europe. Several living specimens were collected from an urban garden in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn in 2015 and 2016, and constitute the first records of this species from New Zealand. Searches in surrounding suburbs have so far failed to find further snails. Eradication from Brooklyn may be viable but it seems likely that the species occurs elsewhere and the potential threat it poses to native species and agriculture, should it become established in New Zealand, appears low.

AB  - Conservation of faunal diversity in highly urbanized landscapes is facilitated through the integration of anthropogenic and natural elements in urban green spaces. Roof gardens have the potential to provide resources for urban wildlife populations, yet they typically offer marginal ecological conditions relative to ground-level habitat so it is necessary to identify the factors associated with focal taxa diversity and abundance to better inform their planning, design, and management. We conducted 20 monthly surveys of diurnal bird and butterfly visitors to 30 urban roof gardens in the tropical city-state of Singapore. Sixty-five site variables were evaluated for their relative importance to four community diversity metrics (species richness, Simpson's diversity, abundance, and functional dispersion) using a conceptual framework relevant to key stakeholders involved in roof garden planning, design, and management. Surveys from a total of 80 observation hours per site recorded more than 23,000 independent bird and butterfly encounters, comprising 53 bird and 57 butterfly species, which represents 13% and 18% of the avifauna and butterfly fauna in Singapore, respectively. Twenty-four species (12 birds, 12 butterflies) were considered uncommon or rare. Reproductive behaviors (courtship, mating, or nesting) were noted in 35 species (20 birds, 15 butterflies). Understory birds were under-represented, whereas understory butterflies were over-represented compared to the overall Singapore fauna. Early morning noise showed strong negative linear correlations with diversity of both taxa, but this variable was also negatively associated with planted area, perhaps indicating proxy effects. Faunal diversity decreased asymptotically with height. Both managed and spontaneous floral diversity had clear positive effects on bird and butterfly diversity. Our results provide clear indication that tropical urban roof gardens can support a diverse subset of the bird and butterfly species assemblages. Site height, site area, and plant selection are suggested to play dominant roles in determining the attractiveness of roof gardens for wildlife. To a first approximation, roof gardens should be built lower than 50 m in height and contain planted areas larger than 1100 m(2), as well as shrubs for birds and both managed and spontaneous nectar plant species for butterflies.

AB  - Unfortunately, we live in a greedy little world and horizontal areas are often too expensive to leave to nature on them. Therefore, creating gardens on vertical surfaces of urban areas has recently been very important to supporting sustainability because these surfaces are still found to be commercially useless compared with green areas which are generally under pressure from commercial demands and politics. However, these artificial vertical green surfaces are still too far from being common, while too many ordinary walls are spontaneously covered with vegetation already. In this study, we try to address the dynamics of wall vegetation as it has a great potential to make the cities more sustainable. Totally 70 walls (35 in urban and 35 in sub-urban areas) in Trabzon city were examined regarding their ecological, physical and vegetation characteristics. Having identified 1540 plant samples collected from the walls during a year-round intensive field study, we performed statistical analyzes to enumerate the wall vegetation depending on the ecological characteristics; to evaluate if there are different wall vegetation compositions in urban and sub-urban areas; and finally to evaluate growth conditions and basic challenges for the wall vegetation.

AB  - Urban gardens are a prominent part of agricultural systems, providing food security and access within cities; however, we still lack sufficient knowledge and general principles about how to manage pests in urban agroecosystems in distinct regions. We surveyed natural enemies (ladybeetles and parasitoids) and conducted sentinel pest removal experiments to explore local management factors and landscape characteristics that influence the provisioning of pest control services in California, USA, and Chiapas, Mexico. We worked in 29 gardens across the two locations. In each location, we collected data on garden vegetation, floral availability, ground cover management, and the percentage of natural, urban, and agricultural land cover in the surrounding landscape. We sampled ladybeetles, Chalcidoidea, and Ichneumonoidea parasitoids with sticky traps, and monitored the removal of three different pest species. Ladybeetle abundance did not differ between locations; abundance decreased with garden size and with tree cover and increased with herbaceous richness, floral abundance, and barren land cover. Chalcicoidea and Ichneumonoidea parasitoids were more abundant in Chiapas. Chalcicoidea abundance decreased with herbaceous richness and with urban cover. Ichneumonoidea abundance increased with mulch and bare ground cover, garden size, garden age, and with agriculture land cover but decreased with tree richness and urban cover. Predators removed between 15-100% of sentinel prey within 24 h but prey removal was greater in California. Generally, prey removal increased with vegetation diversity, floral abundance, mulch cover, and urban land cover, but declined with vegetation cover and bare ground. Although some factors had consistent effects on natural enemies and pest control in the two locations, many did not; thus, we still need more comparative work to further develop our understanding of general principles governing conservation biological control in urban settings.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - British Culex pipiens complex [Culex pipiens sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. Culex (mostly pipiens) is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of Cx pipiens could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female Cx pipiens mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught Cx pipiens. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye.

AB  - Urban gardens can harbour a high diversity of insects, which are critically important components of urban ecosystems. In this work, we investigate the richness and diversity of a major taxon of economic and ecological importance, the aphids (Hemiptera Aphididae), and their main insect predators, the hoverflies (Diptera Syrphidae) and ladybirds (Coleoptera Coccinellidae), in urban gardens. We examined how variation in environmental factors associated with urbanisation (garden host plant abundance, garden plant richness, garden size, proportion of impervious surfaces in the surrounding area) directly and indirectly (via prey and predator abundance) influence the local diversity and abundance of aphids, ladybirds, and hoverflies. Sixty-seven domestic gardens located in southern England were surveyed during the peak period of aphid abundance, and the numbers and identity of aphids and their predators were recorded. We observed 45 aphid species (179917 individuals in total), 15 hoverfly species (494 individuals) and 8 ladybird species (173 individuals). We found that aphid species richness and abundance were positively associated with utilised host plant abundance and garden plant species richness. Hoverfly abundance was positively correlated with garden plant richness. The abundance of ladybirds was positively correlated with aphid abundance and garden plant species richness, and negatively associated to the proportion of impervious surfaces in the surrounding environment. The difference in responses between the two major taxa of aphid predators may reflect differences in their behaviour and natural history. Our results indicate that overall increases in urban land cover are not favourable for ladybirds as a group, and that fine scale habitat variables that are determined by garden owners have the potential to greatly affect the diversity of aphids and their primary predators.

T2  - Ecological Indicators
AB  - In recent years, Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has gained broad political support and has evolved to become a new research topic in the area of sustainable urban development. The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development.

AB  - Questions(a) Will seed banks develop on extensive green roofs (EGRs) - prime examples of novel ecosystems - as in (semi-)natural systems? If so, which type of seed bank (transient or persistent) can be expected? (b) Do EGR characteristics, such as roof age and substrate depth, influence seed bank seed density and species richness? (c) Can differences in successional stages be noticed in the seed bank and vegetation on EGRs? LocationFlanders and Brussels regions of Belgium. MethodsWe conducted a field sampling campaign in which the vegetation and seed bank of 109 EGRs were sampled. Information on roof characteristics (e.g. age, substrate depth) was also collected. Seedling emergence was monitored under standardized greenhouse conditions. Species traits were collected from several existing databases. Data analysis consisted of (generalized) linear mixed modelling. ResultsA total of 18,466 seedlings from 139 different species emerged in the seed bank analysis. Average similarity between vegetation and the seed bank was low, and the majority of species could be considered spontaneous colonizers. Most species were classified as having a transient seed bank. Life forms were shown to be significantly different between vegetation and seed bank. Older EGRs had higher seed bank species richness and seed density, both of which were also positively influenced by sampling date and the vegetation species richness. A discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation successional state, characterized by functional signatures, was present for EGRs. ConclusionsEGRs do develop seed banks and show parallels with seed banks in other novel ecosystems. Seed bank species richness and seed density are influenced by temporal and vegetation related factors. We can also confirm EGR seed bank succession and the discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation successional state, as often observed in natural and novel systems. Furthermore, we argue that seed banks can function as biodiversity reservoirs, which can be considered in EGR vegetation restoration if a set of several conditions is fulfilled. Overall, this study explores seed bank analysis on EGR as a novel ecosystem model. It thereby provides multiple insights in processes impacting EGR plant species diversity, both on and in the soil.

TI  - Sustainability of urban agriculture: vegetable production on green roofs
AU  - Walters, S. Alan
AU  - Midden, Karen S.
T2  - Agriculture
AB  - The practice of producing vegetables on green roofs has been gaining momentum in recent years as a method to facilitate agricultural sustainability in urban areas. Rooftop gardens are becoming an important part of the recent rejuvenation of urban agriculture, and offers alternative spaces to grow vegetable products for urban markets. Green roofs create spaces for the production of vegetable crops, which then generate opportunities for integrating agriculture into urban communities. However, vegetable production activities on rooftops are currently minimal due to multiple challenges that must be overcome before widespread implementation will occur, and these are presented and discussed herein in great detail. Although intensive green roof systems (>15 cm medium depths) are thought to be most suited for vegetable production, the greatest potential for sustained productivity is probably through extensive systems (<15 cm depths) due to weight load restrictions for most buildings. Thus, shallow-rooted vegetables that include important salad greens crops are thought to be the most suited for extensive systems as they can have high productivity with minimal inputs. Research presented herein agree that crops such as lettuce, kale and radish can be produced effectively in an extensive green roof medium with sufficient nutrient and moisture inputs. Other research has indicated that deeper-root crops like tomato can be produced but they will require constant monitoring of fertility and moisture levels. Vegetable production is a definite possibility in urban areas on retrofitted green roofs using minimal growing substrate depths with intensive seasonal maintenance. Rooftop agriculture can improve various ecosystem services, enrich urban biodiversity and reduce food insecurity. Food production provided by green roofs can help support and sustain food for urban communities, as well as provide a unique opportunity to effectively grow food in spaces that are typically unused. The utilization of alternative agricultural production systems, such as green roof technologies, will increase in importance as human populations become more urbanized and urban consumers become more interested in local foods for their families. Although cultivation of food on buildings is a key component to making cities more sustainable and habitable, green roofs are not the total solution to provide food security to cities. They should be viewed more as a supplement to other sources of food production in urban areas.

AB  - Urban ecosystems, as mosaics of residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural land, present challenges for species survival due to impervious surface, degradation, fragmentation, and modification of natural habitat, pollution, and introduced species. Some urban habitats, such as community gardens, support biodiversity and promote ecosystem services. In gardens, local factors (e.g., vegetation, groundcover) and landscape surroundings (e.g., agriculture, built or impervious cover) may influence species abundance, richness, and functional traits that are present. We examined which local and landscape factors within 19 community gardens in the California central coast influence ground beetle (Carabidae) activity density, species richness, functional group richness, and functional traitsbody size, wing morphology, and dispersal ability. Gardens with higher crop richness and that are surrounded by agricultural land had greater carabid activity density, while species and functional group richness did not respond to any local or landscape factor. Gardens with more leaf litter had lower carabid activity, and gardens with more leaf litter tended to have more larger carabids. Changes in local (floral abundance, ground cover) and landscape (urban land cover) factors also influenced the distribution of individuals with certain wing morphology and body size traits. Thus, both local and landscape factors influence the taxonomic and functional traits of carabid communities, with potential implications for pest control services that are provided by carabids.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - During the last years Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has evolved as a research focus across Europe. UGI can be understood as a multifunctional network of different urban green spaces and elements contributing to urban benefits. Urban agriculture has gained increasing research interest in this context. While a strong focus has been made on functions and benefits of small scale activities, the question is still open, whether these findings can be up-scaled and transferred to the farmland scale. Furthermore, multifunctionality of urban and pert-urban agriculture is rarely being considered in the landscape context. This research aims to address these gaps and harnesses the question if agricultural landscapes - which in many European metropolitan regions provide significant spatial potential - can contribute to UGI as multifunctional green spaces. This work considers multifunctionality qualitatively based on stakeholder opinion, using a participatory research approach. This study provides new insights in pert-urban farmland potentials for UGI development, resulting into a strategy framework. Furthermore, it reflects on the role of the stakeholder involvement for multifunctionality planning'. It suggests that it helps to define meaningful bundles of intertwined functions that interact on different scales, helping to deal with non-linearity of multiple functions and to better manage them simultaneously.

T2  - Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems
AB  - In the United States, interest in urban farms and community gardens is nourishing, yet the urban home food garden (UHFG) and its contributions to urban systems have been over looked and understudied. To begin to address this gap, we are conducting a mixed methods study of African American, Chinese-origin and Mexican-origin households with homegardens in Chicago, IL. Study methods include in-depth interviews, participant observation, ethnobotanical surveys and analysis of the chemical and physical properties of garden soils. As of this writing, findings indicate that home gardening has an array of beneficial effects, contributing to household food budgets and community food systems, there production of cultural identity and urban biodiversity. The majority of informants in the study were internal or international migrants. For these individuals, gardening, culture-specific food plant assemblages and the foodways they support represent a continuation of cultural practices and traditional agroecological knowledge associated with their place of origin. The gardens of some migrant households also harbor urban agrobiodiversity with roots in the Global South. At the same time, gardens may have less salubrious effects on urban systems and populations. A lack of knowledge of safe gardening practices may expose vulnerable populations to environmental hazards such as soil contaminants. Gardeners in this study reported using synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides, sometimes indiscriminately, and the repeated application of synthetic fertilizers and compost may contribute to the nutrient loading of urban storm water runoff. These effects may be moderated by the relatively low bulk density and high porosity of garden soils due to tillage and the application of organic matter, which can be expected to enhance stormwater in filtration. While the UHFGs potential contributions to urban systems are significant, outreach and research are needed to help gardeners grow food safely and sustainably in ways that contribute to overall ecosystem health.

AB  - Amidst ongoing urbanization and increased research on urban greenspaces, the biodiversity level of these spaces is an important variable. Attaining biodiversity estimates by asking non-expert greenspace users to assess aspects of a greenspace has a number of advantages over expert assessments (costs, sample size etc.). This article discusses an approach to such a citizen-science assessment of plant species richness using reported garden habitat heterogeneity and visually assisted reported plant species richness. We compare expert-assessed plant species richness with garden owner-generated estimates in a sample of 83 gardens. We show it is possible to predict approx. 50% of variation in plant species richness in gardens using just two visual survey questions regarding habitat heterogeneity and plant species richness.

AB  - In the face of growing urban densification, green spaces in cities, such as gardens, are increasingly important for biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the influences of urban green space management on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships is poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between soil fauna and litter decomposition in 170 urban garden sites along a gradient of urbanisation intensity in the city of Zurich, CH. We used litter bags of 1 and 4 mm mesh size to evaluate the contribution of soil meso- and macrofauna on litter decomposition. By using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we investigated direct and indirect environmental effects and management practices on litter decomposition and litter residue quality. We evaluated the role of taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of soil fauna species on litter decomposition, based on a sample of 120 species (81,007 individuals; 39 collembola, 18 earthworm, 16 isopod, 47 gastropod species). We found highest litter decomposition rates using 4 mm mesh size litter bags, highlighting the importance of soil macrofauna. Urban warming, a proxy for urbanisation intensity, covaried positively, whereas soil disturbances, such as intensive soil and crop management, were negatively correlated with decomposition rates. Interestingly, soil fauna species richness decreased, with the exception of gastropods, and soil fauna abundance increased with urban warming. Our data also show that plant species richness positively affected litter decomposition by increasing soil fauna species richness and microbial activity. A multivariate analysis of organic compounds in litter residues confirmed the importance of soil fauna species richness and garden management on litter decomposition processes. Overall, we showed, that also in intensively managed urban green spaces, such as gardens, biodiversity of plants and soil fauna drives key ecosystem processes. Urban planning strategies that integrate soil protecting management practices may help to maintain important ecosystem services in this heavily used urban environment.

T2  - Urban Ecosystems
AB  - High urbanization pressure in Sub-Saharan Africa led to changes in the composition and configuration of rural and peri-urban agricultural production systems and to the establishment of highly market-oriented urban farming systems. Trees and shrubs, as a key component of agroecosystems, provide ecosystem services that support food security and agricultural productivity. However, the relationship between landscape structure, land use intensification, species diversity and functional diversity of woody plant communities particularly within the semi-arid environment of West Africa has received little attention. We combined GIS analyses and field sampling of woody plant communities of 72 agricultural systems located in rural, peri-urban and urban areas of Tamale (Ghana) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). From a landscape perspective, peri-urban systems in Ouagadougou formed a transition or interacting zone between rural and urban systems and were shaped by urban growth dynamics whereas in Tamale peri-urban systems constituted a simplification of the rural parkland habitats and was mainly determined by agricultural intensification. Woody plant communities showed a high functional richness along the rural-urban gradient and provided a variety of ecosystem services, with food provisioning as main good. A trade-off between two regulating services, bio-control of pests and pollination services, could be observed within urban and in part within peri-urban farming systems. Hence, obtaining a holistic understanding of how landscape structure that is shaped by city growth and agricultural intensification affects ecosystem services is fundamental if West African urban farmers are to be politically supported in their efforts to manage landscapes effectively and to ensure agro-ecosystem multi-functionality and productivity.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Residential yards comprise most land and green space across cities. Despite yards being ubiquitous, little comprehensive information exists on how vegetation varies between front and backyards. This hinders our ability to optimize greening interventions on private urban land. We devised an accurate GIS algorithm to locate and classify front and backyards within residential landscapes. By applying this method to the greater Boston area, we measured vegetation structure (i.e., canopy cover, height and volume) of front and backyards with LiDAR and multispectral imagery. We further investigated relationships between urban form, architectural style, socio-economics, and the structure of front and backyard vegetation across Boston's residential landscapes. Among the 85,732 residential parcels that were not corner lots and had cadastral and architectural data available, backyards were twice as large as front yards on average and had significantly greater canopy cover, vegetation volume and taller trees. Parcel-level characteristics, including vegetation in the corresponding front or backyard, as well as morphological characteristics of parcels, were the best predictors of vegetation structure. House architectural style was related to vegetation structure. The neighborhood socio-economic characteristics were the least important factors in predicting yard vegetation structure. Our study highlights that urban greening in yards depends on urban form and morphology at the parcel scale, and as such, it could be enhanced through urban to provide opportunities for additional vegetation. Architectural style might represent a further filter by which residents manage vegetation in their home environment, making it possible to devise strategies to green our cities - in style.

TI  - Urban heat island effects on moss gardens in Kyoto, Japan
AU  - Oishi, Yoshitaka
T2  - Landscape and Ecological Engineering
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) represent a serious problem for urban biodiversity and landscapes. The impact of UHIs on Japanese gardens are of particular concern because these gardens use moss as a ground cover, and moss can be strongly affected by UHIs due to their sensitivity to drought stress. We studied 17 historical gardens in Kyoto, Japan, and propose an effective management strategy for moss gardens that takes into account the influence of UHIs on these gardens. The study sites included gardens covered by large patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by mosses including small patches of hygrophilous moss, gardens covered by relatively drought-resistant moss, and gardens with small patches of mosses. We measured temperature and relative humidity within the gardens and determined the surrounding land-use types. A comparison of microclimates showed significant differences among garden types. Hygrophilous gardens had the lowest temperature and highest relative humidity, whereas gardens with small patches of moss had the highest temperature and lowest relative humidity. Using structural equation models, we determined that urbanization within 1000 m from the gardens increased temperature and decreased relative humidity, strongly affecting the type of garden. These effects could be attributed to the sensitivity of mosses to changes in microclimate caused by UHIs. Taken together, the results indicate that urban planning-e.g., increasing green space-within 1000 m of moss gardens can maintain those gardens by mitigating the influence of UHIs.

TI  - The influence of microclimate on bryophyte diversity in an urban Japanese garden landscape
AU  - Oishi, Yoshitaka
T2  - Landscape and Ecological Engineering
AB  - Japanese gardens play an important role in the conservation of bryophyte diversity. Previous studies have indicated that diverse garden landscapes and their maintenance as well as garden microclimates can be related to high bryophyte diversity, although it has not been examined how these microclimates differ from those in other land use types and how they affect bryophyte diversity. Therefore, this study analyzed the relationships among microclimate, garden landscape, and bryophyte diversity. The study sites comprised the renowned Saihoji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, and surrounding residential areas and forests. Seventeen 1-m-radius circular plots were established within the study sites, and bryophyte species richness and cover, landscape elements, and microclimates (temperature and relative humidity) were recorded in these plots. Sixty-seven species were identified, including four endangered species, and garden plots showed higher species richness and cover than surrounding areas. Garden microclimates were characterized by significantly lower temperature and higher relative humidity, which can be attributed to a combined influence of garden elements such as large vegetation cover and water surface. Notably, these microclimates can significantly and positively affect bryophyte diversity by mitigating drought stress. Thus, Japanese gardens featuring large vegetation cover and water surface can function as conservation sites for drought-sensitive species, increasing urban bryophyte diversity. Conservation of bryophytes might be beneficial to urban biodiversity and resilience reinforcement by promoting biological interactions among several species and improving ecological functions.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Horticulture has long been an important source of exotic plant species that may naturalize and become invasive. To analyze the extent of exotic plant species and their possible preference in modern landscaping in Rochester, New York, USA, we inventoried 101 randomly chosen suburban (peri-urban) house gardens. On average, 72% of plants per property were not native to the Eastern United States. Of the exotic species present in gardens, 44% have naturalized in New York State. Additionally, invasive plants were often intentionally planted, such as Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), which was found in nearly half of the gardens. We also sought to ascertain if garden diversity could be correlated with the age, size, or cost of properties. Although our findings were not as distinct as previous garden inventories, property size and mortgage value correlated positively with species richness. Overall, landscape trends across all property types favored exotic over native garden plants.

AB  - Urban agriculture is making an increasing contribution to food security in large cities
around the world. The potential contribution of biodiversity to ecological intensification in urban
agricultural systems has not been investigated. We present monitoring data collected from rice
fields in 34 community farms in mega-urban Shanghai, China, from 2001 to 2015, and show that the presence of a border crop of soybeans and neighboring crops (maize, eggplant and Chinese
cabbage), both without weed control, increased invertebrate predator abundance, decreased the
abundance of pests and dependence on insecticides, and increased grain yield and economic
profits. Two 2 year randomized experiments with the low and high diversity practices in the same
locations confirmed these results. Our study shows that diversifying farming practices can make an important contribution to ecological intensification and the sustainable use of associated
ecosystem services in an urban ecosystem.

T2  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
AB  - Gardens are hot spots for urban biodiversity and provide habitats for many plant and animal species, both above- and below-ground. Furthermore, gardens provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage and nutrient cycling. Although the soil is the foundation of sustainable gardens providing those ecosystem services, very little is known about the consequences of garden management on soil quality. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of urban garden soil quality, including biotic and abiotic site characteristics combined with land-use history and garden management information in a multivariate evaluation. A set of 44 soil quality indicators was measured at 170 sites of 85 gardens in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, comprising contrastingly managed garden habitats along a gradient of urban density. Taken together, our results show that garden management was the driving factor that influenced soil quality and soil functions. Eco-physiological soil quality indices were useful to identify differences in disturbance and intensity of soil use, showing highest microbial [microbial biomass (C-m(i)c)/soil organic carbon (SOC)] and lowest metabolic (qCO(2)) quotients in perennial grass sites compared to annual vegetable sites. Despite the intensity of soil disturbance in annual vegetable and flower beds, the highest endogeic earthworm biomass and diversity were found in those habitats. Whereas decomposition of green tea bags was higher in grass sites. Soil heavy metal contents varied considerably and could not be linked with garden management practices, but with spatial patterns of industry and traffic. We conclude that understanding soil quality in urban ecosystems needs multi-indicator frameworks to capture the complexity of soil characteristics and the influencing factors in space and time. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban gardens and enhances the development of sustainable soil management strategies aimed at long-term improvement of soil quality and related ecosystem services in cities.

AB  - 1. Context Urban areas are often contaminated with various forms of persistent metal (loid) and emerging contaminants such as antimony (Sb). Thus, in the context of urban agriculture where sustainable practices such as biofertilizers application (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF) could improve nutrient transfer from the soil to the vegetables, the effect of AMF on metal (loid) mobility and human bioaccessibility is still poorly known. 2. Methods The role of AMF in Sb uptake by lettuce and carrot grown in artificial substrate spiked with different Sb chemical species was investigated. Plants were grown under hydroponic conditions and half of the treatments received a concentrated spore solution to obtain mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. Three weeks before harvest, plants were exposed to 10 mg.L-1 of either Sb2O3 or KSbO-tartrate (KSb). 3. Results The presence of AMF significantly increased its accumulation in carrots (all organs) with higher accumulation in roots. In lettuce, accumulation appeared to be dependent on the Sb chemical species. Moreover, it was observed for the first time that AMF changed the human bioaccessible fraction of Sb in edible organs. 4. Implications The present results highlight a possible risk of Sb transfer from soil to edible plants cultivated in soil naturally containing AMF propagules, or when AMF are added as biofertilizers. After validating the influence of soil environment and AMF on Sb behavior in the field, these results should be considered in health risk assessments.

AB  - Diversity is one of the most important traits of homegardens and contributes to maintaining their functions. Here, we investigated the diversity, characteristics, and functions of 75 Karen homegardens from four villages in Chiang Mai and Tak provinces in northern Thailand. In each homegarden, all used plant species were registered and classified according to their main use. The diversity and richness in each homegarden was estimated and the stratification of plants in horizontal zones was investigated. A total 268 plant species were recorded, ranging from 100 to 146 species in each of the four villages. These plants were mostly kept in the homegarden yard or along their boundaries. The most common species were mango (Mangifera indica L.), jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.), guava (Psidium guajava L.), and taro Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott. Besides these species, most plants differed from one village to another. Distance between the homegardens was important; homegardens in the same village were more similar than those in different villages. However, beyond the individual level, the distances alone could not be used to determine similarity. Despite the variation of species found in homegardens, the function and horizontal stratification of the Karen homegardens shared many traits. They satisfied both physical and aesthetic needs to the Karen people as witnessed by the high proportion of food and ornamental species. The reverse effects of urbanization (we used the distance from the nearest urban area as a proxy) on the diversity of ornamental species was also observed. In general, Karen homegardens had high richness and diversity which directly benefited the conservation of plant species. This diversity promotes food security at the household and community levels.

AU  - Materechera, Simeon A.
T2  - Journal of Soils and Sediments
AB  - Urban and peri-urban agriculture is becoming increasingly important as a source of income and food for the urban population in South Africa. While most studies on urban agriculture have focused their attention on surface soils, there is dearth of information regarding subsoil properties. This study examined properties of subsoil horizons that may impede root growth and productivity of crops under urban agriculture. The properties of topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil horizons (20-40 cm) of four profiles from plots within the city of Mahikeng (25A degrees 48' S and 25A degrees 38' E) were examined to determine the nature of subsoil constraints that can limit root growth and crop productivity. The plots were selected in an area extending through four residential suburbs of the city, and two plots with a long history of cultivation were purposely selected from each suburb to represent the main cropping systems and soil types. Soil physical (penetrometer resistance, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity), chemical (pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na, phosphorus and boron) and biological (root growth, organic carbon, microbial biomass, enzyme activity) properties were measured in the profiles. Even though there was a large variability between profiles, the results revealed high bulk density (mean 2.06 Mg m(-3)) at the top of the subsoil for all the profiles. The corresponding mean penetrometer resistance was 1.89 MPa implying high mechanical resistance to root growth in this layer. The hydraulic conductivities at saturation were below 12 mm h(-1) suggesting low drainage which may result in perched water table and waterlogging leading to depleted oxygen in the root zone. The pH in all the profiles was slightly acid to moderate alkaline (6.1-8.3, in water), and low levels of plant available boron (B) were found in the subsoil layers. Most of the profiles had extreme values of physical properties that would constrain root growth. All the subsoil layers had significantly (p < 0.05) lower root growth, organic carbon, microbial biomass and enzyme activity. It was concluded that subsoil constraints to root growth appear to be widespread in profiles of soils used for urban and peri-urban agriculture in the city of Mahikeng. Given that studying and ameliorating subsoil constraints is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, it is recommended that periodic deep ploughing and inclusion of plants with roots which are tolerant or resistant to these conditions be considered as part of routine soil management practice in plots used for urban agriculture.

AB  - The expansion of the Shanghai metropolitan region has caused a substantial amount of farmland to become urbanized. Most farmers have lost their land and have been relocated from villages to new collective settlements, resulting in dramatic changes in the landscape pattern. This study explores the effects of this transformation on the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant diversity. We randomly sampled 22 plots comprising 294 subplots within two crossed transects that pass through 5 traditional villages and 17 new settlements. The results show that resettlement has exerted significant effects on plant species diversity, both temporally and spatially. Temporally, the Gleason index (GI) of total species over time could be ordered as 1990s > 2000s > 1980s, while Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) was ordered as 2000s > 1990s > 1980s. Spatially, the GI of total species decreased from the urban center to the exurbs or from the inside to the outside of the built-up areas. SHDI was highest in suburbs or ecotones. Furthermore, the GI of total species had significant correlations with those of indigenous species, exotic species, and planted species (r > 0.90, p < 0.01) as well as with the region and location of settlement (r < -0.48, p < 0.01). Both indigenous and exotic species had significant positive correlations with total species richness at 0.01 levels. Generally, compared with traditional settlements, new settlements displayed greater richness and diversity of plant species, primarily because of the exotic species present in new settlements. The farmers' socio-economic status was found to be the primary cause of differences in species richness. To protect indigenous and wild species, it is necessary to take into account local knowledge in villages to encourage Chinese farmers to participate actively in community greening. A bridge should be built between traditional villages and modern settlements and between the past and future for farmers.

AB  - Residential green areas often represent a significant portion of a city's green infrastructure which has generated great interest in studying the factors that contribute to the formation of plant associations in residential yards. This project evaluated the external factors to the household social-ecological system that influence the availability of plants for residential landscapes and how they may influence the presence of native plants in residential yards on households within the Rio Piedras watershed in the metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The methods used included a residential survey with open and closed questions that addressed the sources of plants used in landscaping and an evaluation of ornamental plant species inventories from local nurseries. A total of 432 yards were surveyed. Yard plants in this watershed have multiple sources. Aside from obtaining plants at local nurseries, natural dispersion, exchanges among family and friends and historical plantings can be just as important sources of yard plants. Our results also suggest that the majority of residents do not know where to get native plants which could represent a challenge for the development and implementation of initiatives for natives gardening. At the same time, most commercial nurseries have a deficit of native plants in their inventories. This information is critical to species conservation strategies that seek the inclusion of urban residential areas and may help improve initiatives about the involvement of individual citizens in sustainable gardening practices at the residential scale.

T2  - Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems
AB  - With increasing urbanization and environmental degradation, urban landscapes are increasingly expected to provide a wide range of ecosystem services typically associated with rural areas, including biodiversity conservation and food production. Because residential landscapes constitute the largest single urban land use, domestic gardens have emerged as a topic of research interest and planning concern. The ecosystem services (or disservices) these landscapes provide, however, have not been rigorously measured, nor have tradeoffs between the services they provide been assessed. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 59 African American, Chinese-origin or Mexican-origin households with on-lot or vacant lot food gardens in Chicago. Crop plants and cultivated ornamental plants on the lot were inventoried and mapped at the species level. A total of 123 edible plant taxa from 25 families and 288 ornamental plant species from 85 families were identified, for a combined total of 387 species from 90 families. Cumulatively, the gardens of African American households were relatively rich in ornamental plant species and families, while those of Chinese-origin households had a depauperate flora. Crop plant richness was more even across sample types. Shade trees and a developed shrub layer were absent from most gardens, possibly representing a trade off in ecosystem services in favor of food production. The richness of the aggregate 2.1 ha of residential property inventoried in this study was comparable with or exceeded that of a 34 ha prairie remnant west of Chicago. However, only 35 (9.6%) of the inventoried species were native to the Chicago area.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - Domestic gardens contribute substantially to green spaces in cities, where urbanization removes and fragments natural landscapes, causing the loss of biodiversity and the homogenization of biota. We analyzed the diversity and composition of the flora of 70 domestic gardens in seven localities in Bogota, Colombia, which represent different periods of expansion of the city. Floristic composition and diversity were related to the origin and use of plants, the urbanization history, and the income of owners. We recorded 4110 individuals belonging to 238 species. The mean species richness per garden was 15.4, with older localities having significantly higher species richness. The similarity among the localities, which evaluated the distinctness of assemblages, ranged from 0.42 to 0.50. Plants from the Neotropical region and exotic plants were the most abundant in all gardens. The most common use was ornamental, and use depended on the socioeconomic status of the owner. The lower-income homes cultivated larger proportions of edible and medicinal plants. Gardens at the oldest localities, with the largest number of native species, contribute to the conservation of flora because they contain the largest number of native species. Furthermore, domestic gardens are good sources of employment for gardeners and are useful places to keep senior citizens active, helping these citizens relieve stress, maintain good health and teach young people the cultural uses of plants. The receptivity of the homeowners to the study opens the door to future research and conservation programs in the city.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed that manor gardens may serve as local hotspots of biodiversity and provide cultural ecosystem services. As a consequence of dramatic land-use changes in recent centuries, followed by significant loss and degradation of natural habitats, manor gardens often serve as harbors for organisms within the cultural landscape. We randomly selected 98 manor gardens, followed by a grid overlay of data from the national natural habitats mapping system. Proportions of natural habitats were calculated for each garden in relation to the surrounding landscape. The results provide information about importance of manor gardens for biodiversity conservation through findings that especially large manor gardens, compared with the surrounding landscape, contain an important proportion of natural habitats, particularly in areas with a high level of human impact. For the gardens, occurrence of the following formation groups of the natural habitats was recorded forests (total proportion of all kinds of forests habitats is 25.4% of the gardens area), secondary semi-natural grasslands (4.4%), streams and water bodies (1.6%) and wetlands and riverine vegetation (0.5%). The significantly high proportion of natural habitats in manor gardens was found mainly for beech forests and for secondary semi-natural grasslands, especially mesic and montane meadows. No significant importance was proven for wetland habitats. We conclude that nature friendly managed manor gardens can provide a conservation function of local natural habitats and their biodiversity especially in intensively managed landscapes.

AB  - Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden Will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application ('sub-surface' and 'surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.

T2  - Acta Botanica Brasilica
AB  - The study of urban home gardens is still a current gap in knowledge in Brazilian ethnobotany researches, especially in the south of Brazil. This study was carried out to survey the species composition of plants in urban residential home gardens of two neighborhoods in the municipality of Chapeco (state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil) an older neighborhood created prior to the 1950s, and a younger neighborhood created in the decade 1970-1980. It was hypothesized that the home gardens in the older neighborhood would be larger and have greater species richness than those in the younger neighborhood. Data from 10 home gardens in each neighborhood were collected through semi-structured interviews. The plants cited by interviewees were classified as used for alimentary, medicinal and/or ornamental purposes. A total of 372 plant species (256 in the older neighborhood and 248 in the younger one) were recorded. The two neighborhoods differed in the size of their home gardens, but had similar species richness. The high species richness of plants cultivated for alimentary, medicinal and ornamental purposes in both Chapeco neighborhoods indicates that these spaces are an important resource for food, subsistence and well-being.

AB  - Considerable research has examined the social, cultural, economic, and community benefits of urban gardening. Few studies, however, have empirically assessed factors that influence urban community garden agrodiversity or its relationship to these dimensions of gardening. We conducted an interdisciplinary study of agrodiversity and cultural identity, based certain markers of identity, including how people see themselves with respect to race, ethnicity, or place of origin, in community gardens in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We conducted fifty-six semistructured interviews with gardeners with different cultural identities in eight community gardens on their motivations for urban community gardening during 2014. We conducted plant inventories of the corresponding garden plots and found 104 cultivated edible and ornamental species and 28 varieties representing 34 families. We find that although gardens with culturally diverse gardeners did not have higher species richness, the cultural identity of the gardeners influenced species selection and reason for gardening. Further, the structure, design and species composition of garden plots reflected the identities of garden members. These finding have implications for the recent institutionalization of urban agriculture into city land policies in Philadelphia and other cities in North America.

AB  - This was an ethnobotanical study of medicinal plants occurring in home gardens in the northern Brazilian Para state. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the owners of 233 home gardens selected by probability sampling. We analyzed the data qualitatively, complemented by indices Total Species Diversity and Total Species Equitability (SDtot and SEtot, respectively); Use Value (UVs); Importance Value (IVs); and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF). We identified 124 species within 107 genera and 55 families. Of the medicinal species identified, 17.6% were considered effective in the treatment of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases. The home gardens evaluated harbored a great diversity of medicinal species (SDtot-47.43), although knowledge of the plants was not distributed evenly (SEtot-0.383). Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.) Pers. showed the highest UVs (0.462) and Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. ex Britton & P.Wilson showed the highest IVs (0.104). The highest ICF value (0.94) was for the treatment of Behavioural Disorders.

T2  - Biological Invasions
AB  - Ornamental horticulture is the most important pathway for alien plant introductions worldwide, and consequently, invasive spread of introduced plants often begins in urban areas. Although most introduced ornamental garden-plant species are locally not naturalized yet, many of them have shown invasion potential elsewhere in the world, and might naturalize when climate changes. We inventoried the planted flora of 50 public and 61 private gardens in Radolfzell, a small city in southern Germany, to investigate whether local naturalization success of garden plants is associated with their current planting frequency, climatic suitability (as assessed with climatic niche modelling) and known naturalization status somewhere in the world. We identified 954 introduced garden-plant species, of which 48 are already naturalized in Radolfzell and 120 in other parts of Germany. All currently naturalized garden plants in Radolfzell have a climatic suitability probability of >= 0.75 and are naturalized in >= 13 out of 843 regions globally. These values are significantly higher than those of garden plants that have not become locally naturalized yet. Current planting frequencies, however, were not related to current naturalization success. Using the identified local naturalization thresholds of climatic suitability and global naturalization frequency, and climate projections for the years 2050 and 2070, we identified 45 garden-plant species that are currently not naturalized in Radolfzell but are likely to become so in the future. Although our approach cannot replace a full risk assessment, it is well-suited and applicable as one element of a screening or horizon scanning-type approach.

T2  - Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems
AB  - Allotment food gardens represent important sources of food security for urban residents. Since urban gardeners rarely receive formal agricultural education and have extremely limited space, they may be relying on readily available gardening advice (e.g., seed packet instructions), inventing cultural strategies that consider inter-specific competitive dynamics, or making poor planting decisions. Knowledge of garden crop diversity and planting arrangements can aid in designing strategies for productive urban gardens and food systems. We surveyed 96 individual plots in 10 allotment gardens in the Toronto region, assessed crop diversity within gardens and recorded planting practices used by urban gardeners by measuring the proximity of individual plants relative to similar or different crop species. We also compared planting densities used by urban gardeners with those recommended by major seed distributers. Collectively, Toronto urban agriculture contributes substantially to urban plant diversity (108 crops), but each plot tends to be relatively depauperate. Carrots and lettuce were three to five times more likely to be planted in clusters than intermingled with other crops (P < 0.05); whereas gardeners did not appear to use consistent planting arrangements for tomatoes or zucchini. Gardeners tended to plant tomatoes and zucchini 56-62.5% more densely than recommended by seed distributers (P < 0.001), whereas they planted 147 times fewer carrots in a given area than recommended (P < 0.05). Furthermore, neither crop planting density nor crop diversity changed with plot size. The planting arrangements we have documented suggest gardeners using allotment plots attempt plant densely in extremely limited space, and are employing cultural strategies that intensify competitive dynamics within gardens. Future research should assess the absolute and relative effect of altered cultural practices on yield, such that any modifications can be prioritized by their impact on yield.

AB  - Ornamental plants constitute an important source of alien, and potentially invasive species, but also include a substantial part of native flora and consist of taxa that occur both in the wild and in cultivation; yet garden floras are largely ignored in ecological studies. We studied ornamental plants in the Czech Republic in order to provide detailed information, based on field sampling, on the diversity of taxa grown in cultivation in private gardens. Sampling was done in accessible public areas, private gardens and private areas in villages, town- and city neighbourhoods, garden allotments, cemeteries, areas of dispersed farmhouse settlements not accessible to the public, and in new urban sprawl. The data can be used to estimate the propagule pressure of individual taxa, measured in terms of the frequency with which they are planted in the gardens. To make the data comparable across sites, we adopted a two-level approach that resulted in producing a detailed list (including all the taxa recorded) and an aggregated list (merging closely related and similar taxa, which was necessary in order to assess the frequency of planting across sites). Each species on the detailed list was assigned an origin, status, life history and cultivation requirements. Comparing the field records with national checklists of both native and alien vascular plants we quantified particular components of the ornamental flora. The floristic inventories for 174 sites yielded 1842 taxa on the detailed list, consisting of 1642 species (standard binomials), 9 cultivars assigned to genera, 147 hybrids and hybridogenous taxa, and 44 taxa identified at higher than species level. Of these taxa 1417 (76.9%) were alien and 420 (22.8%) native. The ornamental flora consisted of not-escaping aliens, escaping aliens and cultivated natives. Of the recorded taxa, 841 (45.6%) occur both in cultivation and the wild. The aggregated list comprised 1514 taxa and resulted from merging 533 taxa from the detailed list into 205 taxa. Most alien ornamentals are native to Asia and Americas. The proportion of escaped and not-escaping aliens significantly differed from wild aliens in the spontaneous flora with underrepresentation of escaped, which originated from Australia, Africa and the Mediterranean area. Taxa from Africa and anecophytes were overrepresented and those from Australia, the Mediterranean and other parts of Europe underrepresented among not escaping aliens. The assessment of planting frequency revealed that 270 taxa were found at more than 25% of the sites, while 584 (40%) occurred at only one or two sites. Winter annuals and shrubs are most represented among the commonly planted aliens; the only native species with comparably high planting frequencies among the aliens, are Vinca minor, Hedera helix and Aquilegia vulgaris. Related to the invasion potential of ornamental garden flora we analysed the recorded taxa with respect to the transient/persistent character of their occurrence. The core (persistent) part of the flora comprised 599 taxa (32% of the total number of taxa) and the transient 240 (13%) taxa. The "grey zone" between the two included 1003 taxa (55%). The results reported here provide quantitative insights into the role of horticulture as a major pathway of plant invasions.

AB  - Woody Plant Diversity in Urban Homegardens in Northern Thailand. Homegardens are traditional farming systems located within homesteads and are found in many countries throughout the world. The main functions of the homegardens are providing food and other goods for the household and also contributing to the generation of cash income. The number of species found in homegardens is an important trait that reflects their versatility and multiple uses. Woody homegarden plants are important because, being perennial, they represent stability from year to year, and they also produce large amounts of fruits and leaves which are important for food security and income generation. Most homegarden studies have focused on rural areas while urban homegardens have received little attention. In this study we show the importance of homegardens in an urban area by investigating woody plant diversity and the factors that drive this trait in a village in northern Thailand. We identified 94 woody plant species, most of which had edible fruits. The most common was mango (Mangifera indica), whereas economically the most important woody plant was the white fig (Ficus virens), which generated about USD 40 two times a year per tree. Thirteen household characteristics were examined using nonlinear principle analysis (NLPCA) in three dimension. Only the household head's level of education, occupation, and the age of the household were significantly correlated with diversity indices. Moreover, diversity (Shannon and Gini-Simpson indices) of woody plants was significantly correlated with abundance and overall species richness. However, evenness was negatively correlated with abundance.

AB  - About 52% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, and 41% of urban land in developed countries is used for residential areas. The amount and quality of residential green space, an important element in urban residential infrastructure, is closely correlated to city dwellers' quality of life. The quality of green spaces is not only closely correlated to the ecosystem services they provide, but also to their disservices. In order to (i) examine how plant diversity and plant traits vary in different residential areas, (ii) determine the main socio-economic factors driving plant trait variations across different residential areas, and (iii) provide an overview on selected ecosystem services and disservices related to plant diversity, we investigated the flora and socio-economic properties of 83 residential areas in Beijing, China. We found a total of 369 plant species belonging to 99 families and 150 genera. With respect to plant traits, there were 90 annual species, 174 alien species, 169 pollen allergenic species, and 133 species with edible or pharmaceutical value. The number of perennial, alien, ornamental and edible plant species was largest in residential areas completed in the 1990s. The number of allergenic species was highest in residential areas completed prior to 1980. The Simpson, Shannon and Pielou indices for trees and shrubs were highest in areas completed in the 1990s, while those same indices for herbs were highest in residential areas completed prior to 1980. General Linear Model analyses revealed that richness increased with increasing housing price across all groups of species. Principal Component Analysis indicated that housing price and floor-area ratio are the variables that positively correlate with species richness for all groups of species.

AB  - Urbanization has intensified in developing countries in recent years, resulting in a large number of landless farmers. In China, 87 % of them have relocated from scattered villages to collective housing. This study took Shanghai as a case to explore the differences in plant landscapes between farmers' settlement types. We randomly sampled 22 plots (made up of 294 subplots), consisting of five traditional villages and 17 modern quarters (four low-rise, six multilayer, four mixed-layer and three high-rise). Plant species composition and diversity were surveyed and analyzed. Results showed that (a) villages had higher percentages of indigenous species, wild species and fruit and vegetable species than quarters, though there were lower species richness and Shannon' Diversity at villages than at quarters. (b) The defoliation ratio (based on the number of evergreen species to the number of deciduous species) was lower at villages than at quarters (0.73 vs. 1.21, respectively). (c) Metasequoia glyptostroboides (deciduous) was dominant species for villages and Osmanthus fragrans (evergreen) was dominant species for quarters, while Cinnamomum camphora (evergreen) was common dominant species for villages and quarters. Our research suggests that village landscape has advantages of the conservation of indigenous plant species and the relative balance between daylighting and greening adjacent to buildings. Furthermore, the highest species richness at low-rise quarters shows the advantage of multi-stakeholder participation of developers, property companies and resident farmers driving species diversity.

AB  - Urbanisation creates altered environments characterised by increased human habitation, impermeable surfaces, artificial structures, landscape fragmentation, habitat loss, resulting in different resource loss pathways. The vulnerable Rand Highveld Grassland vegetation unit in the Tlokwe Municipal area, South Africa, has been extensively affected and transformed by urbanisation, agriculture, and mining. Grassland fragments in urban areas are often considered to be less species rich and less functional than in the more untransformed or "natural" exurban environments, and are therefore seldom a priority for conservation. Furthermore, urban grassland fragments are often being more intensely managed than exurban areas, such as consistent mowing in open urban areas. Four urbanisation measures acting as indicators for patterns and processes associated with urban areas were calculated for matrix areas surrounding each selected grassland fragment to quantify the position of each grassland remnant along an urbanisation gradient. The grassland fragments were objectively classified into two classes of urbanisation, namely "exurban" and "urban" based on the urbanisation measure values. Grazing was recorded in some exurban grasslands and mowing in some urban grassland fragments. Unmanaged grassland fragments were present in both urban and exurban areas. Fine-scale biophysical landscape function was determined by executing the Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) method. LFA assesses fine-scale landscape patchiness (entailing resource conserving potential and erosion resistance) and 11 soil surface indicators to produce three main LFA parameters (stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling), which indicates how well a system is functioning in terms of fine-scale biophysical soil processes and characteristics. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of urbanisation and associated management practices on finescale biophysical landscape function of urban and exurban grassland fragments, as well as to determine the potential for the use of LFA in decision-making involving the conservation of grassland fragments. The results indicated that the occurrence, size and characteristics of vegetated patches, and especially the presence of litter abundances, were the main factors determining differences in the LFA indices. Furthermore, mowing resulted in the overall fine-scale biophysical indices being higher for some of the urban grassland fragments. This implied that it is not necessarily the influence of urbanisation entailing high or low resource conserving patchiness and patch quality, but rather the management practices associated with urban and exurban areas. Therefore, from a conservation point of view, the grassland fragments in the City of Potchefstroom are just as conservable (on a biophysical function level involving soil processes) than the more "natural" exurban grassland fragments.

AB  - Urban areas, in particular, present unique challenges for the conservation of ecosystems. Allotment gardens (AGs) are an important greenspace feature of urban landscapes in Europe which have the potential to offer multiple social and bio-physical ecosystem services in addition to food production. This study is an attempt to assess and compare the ecosystem services provided by AGs in Manchester, UK, and Poznan, Poland as well as a comparison to city parks. The surveys included a detailed land cover characterisation and an assessment of cultivated and spontaneous plant species. There are differences in the land use characteristics in the two cities with a preference for vegetable growing and water recycling in Manchester, and a greater number of trees and a higher focus on recreation in Poznan. The consequences of these basic differences are discussed in terms of the ecosystem services that are provided by the two different AG types, and parks. In terms of ecology, there is higher species richness on AGs with a greater proportion of neophytes, which may potentially spread into cities. The species recorded in parks and AGs contained a lot of native characteristics of urban, ruderal plant communities.

We characterized livelihoods and compared attributes of home gardens of rural, semi-rural, and peri-urban families in Campeche, M,xico. We hypothesized a decline of agrobiodiversity of cultivated trees and shrubs, its native component, and the diversity of uses from rural to peri-urban livelihoods, and increases for cultivated herbs. We registered all cultivated species in 12 randomly selected home gardens in each condition, and determined species' origin and use. Total and average observed species richness of trees and shrubs in rural and semi-rural home gardens was similar and higher than in peri-urban home gardens, but equally sized samples all had similar richness. Tree density and basal area were largest in semi-rural home gardens. Total observed and average species richness of herbs increased along the rural-peri-urban gradient, and richness of equally sized samples of herbs was higher in peri-urban than in rural and semi-rural home gardens. Peri-urban home gardens had the highest richness of equally sized samples of all plants. Differences in richness were associated with a shift in livelihoods, influencing plant uses, and hence species composition along the gradient peri-urban families combined some fruit trees with a large diversity of ornamental herbs. Rural and semi-rural families maintained tree and shrub species of distinct uses, cultivated less ornamental species and a larger native component than peri-urban home gardens. We conclude that agrobiodiversity does not decline along the rural-peri-urban gradient, but differentiates.

AB  - The objective of this study was to document useful plants in urban domestic gardens in the Limpopo Province, South Africa. Data on plant use categories of urban domestic gardens in the under-developed areas Of the Limpopo Province were collected by means of interviews and personal observations between May and October 2012.A total of 126 taxa belonging to 110 genera and 62 families were recorded from 62 urban domestic gardens. More than half of the species (52.4%) recorded in the surveyed domestic gardens are exotic to South Africa and 9.5 percent of the total garden flora are "indigenous cultivated", introduced in the Limpopo Province from other provinces of South Africa. The dominant plant use category in domestic gardens was Ornamental, followed by fruit trees. The present study revealed that plants grown and maintained in urban domestic gardens play a Vital role in the livelihoods of the people of Limpopo Province.

AB  - Green spaces within residential areas provide important contributions to the sustainability of urban systems. Therefore, studying the characteristics of these areas has become a research priority in cities worldwide. This project evaluated various aspects of the plant biodiversity of residential yards (i.e., front yards and back yards within the Rio Piedras watershed in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico). Our work included gathering information on vegetation composition and abundance of woody species (i.e., trees, shrubs, palms, ferns) and large herbs (>2 m height), species origin (native vs. introduced), and species uses (ornamental, food, and medicinal plants). A total of 424 yards were surveyed within an area of 187,191 m(2). We found 383 woody species, with shrubs being the most abundant plant habitat. As expected, residential yards hosted a disproportionate amount of introduced species (69.5%). The most common shrub species were all non-native ornamentals, whereas the most common tree species included food trees as well as ornamental plants and two native species. Front yards hosted more ornamental species per unit area than backyards, while the latter had more food plants. The high amount of introduced species may present a challenge in terms of implementation of plant conservation initiatives if there is no clear definition of urban conservation goals. On the other hand, the high frequency of yards containing food plants may facilitate the development of residential initiatives that could provide future adaptive capacity to food shortages.

AB  - Vegetation in private gardens contributes significantly to plant species richness and vegetation volume across urban areas. Drivers of garden diversity and structure are complex, reflecting the diversity of social, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of the householders who manage their gardens, as well as their predecessors. Here we investigate the woodiness of gardens, and focus on (1) the prevalence of native versus exotic woody plants and (2) the influence of characteristics of garden owners, the gardens, and their proximity to neighborhood green spaces to identify the degree to which these factors explain patterns in native and exotic woody species communities in entire (back and front) gardens in southern temperate New Zealand. We found few consistent patterns in structure in woody species community composition. Outlying gardens were characterized by low species richness and abundance. Thirty-seven species commonly occurred across most gardens most of these were exotic. Twelve native species were common throughout most gardens. There was significant but weak matching to social and environmental variables vegetated area, species knowledge, and education explained pattern in native communities, whereas vegetated area, species knowledge, and householder age explained variation in exotic communities. Native trees >5 m tall occurred in only 58% of gardens. Tall tree density was 10/ha, and 29% of gardens lacked any trees >5 m. Tree presence was weakly (positively) associated with extent and proximity of neighborhood green space. We suggest that the legacy of previous owners' gardening practices is important to consider when identifying drivers of garden plant community structure.

AU  - Smith, Lionel S.

T2  - Urban Forestry & Urban Greening
AB  - In Britain, managed grass lawns provide the most traditional and widespread of garden and landscape practices in use today. Grass lawns are coming under increasing challenge as they tend to support a low level of biodiversity and can require substantial additional inputs to maintain. Here we apply a novel approach to the traditional monocultural lawnscape by replacing grasses entirely with clonal perennial forbs. We monitored changes in plant coverage and species composition over a two year period and here we report the results of a study comparing plant origin (native, non-native and mixed) and mowing regime. This allows us to assess the viability of this construct as an alternative to traditional grass lawns. Grass-free lawns provided a similar level of plant cover to grass lawns. Both the mowing regime and the combination of species used affected this outcome, with native plant species seen to have the highest survival rates, and mowing at 4 cm to produce the greatest amount of ground coverage and plant species diversity within grass-free lawns. Grass-free lawns required over 50 percent less mowing than a traditionally managed grass lawn. Observations suggest that plant forms that exhibited (a) a relatively fast growth rate, (b) a relatively large individual leaf area, and (c) an average leaf height substantially above the cut to be applied, were unsuitable for use in grass-free lawns. With an equivalent level of ground coverage to grass lawns, increased plant diversity and a reduced need for mowing, the grass-free lawn can be seen as a species diverse, lower input and potentially highly ornamental alternative to the traditional lawn format.

AB  - Although urban sprawl is increasingly becoming a worldwide problem, the effects associated with urbanization on local biodiversity particularly in the developing countries, is still poorly understood. We investigated plant species richness along urban-rural gradients in an Afro-tropical metropolitan Morogoro city in Tanzania, and examined patterns of species movement by humans within and outside the city and its potential impact on habitat homogenization of urban ecosystems. Biodiversity information was assessed in 120 sample plots (25 x 25 m) distributed in core urban, sub-urban and peri-urban (rural) zones, while patterns of plant resource use and species movement were surveyed from 120 households in the study area. We found the highest tree species richness in the urban core (82.6 +/- A 1.4 species) whereas tree density decreased from peri-urban (465.60 +/- A 152.03 tree/ha) to urban core (244.00 +/- A 120.86 tree/ha) and species diversity decreased from urban core (alpha A = 2.82 +/- A 0.01) to peri-urban area (alpha A = 2.61 +/- A 0.23). Further, the proportion of exotic species was significantly higher (75.6 %) than that of native species in the study area (p = 0.001). Tree community assemblages showed least differences among the study zones (dissimilarity = 10 %) and appear to have been influenced by local cultural differences, species movement as well as local resource use. Furthermore, species movement exhibited a random and multi-directional pattern perpetuated by human and nonhuman factors. Movements were significantly higher between backyard gardens within the city than from outside. Alien species by far outnumbered native plant species moving across urban landscapes, potentially increasing species homogenization. Conservation awareness is needed to avoid habitat homogenization due to problems associated with urban sprawl and to maintain heterogeneous habitats for the urban wildlife.

AB  - Background Relatively little has been researched or published on the importance of peri-urban domestic gardens as part of a household livelihood strategy in South Africa. Due to lack of comprehensive data on peri-urban domestic gardens, their potential value as luxury green space, provision of food, income and ecosystem services to the fast growing urban population in South Africa is not clearly known. The aim of this study was to document differences and similarities in plant use and diversity in domestic gardens of two peri-urban communities in the Limpopo Province that differ in proximity to an urban area. Methods Data on plant use categories of 62 domestic gardens in the peri-urban areas of the Limpopo Province were collected in Seshego and Lebowakgomo. Semi-structured interviews, observation and guided field walks with 62 participants were employed between May and October 2012. Results A total of 126 plant species were recorded for both Seshego and Lebowakgomo. Domestic gardens in the more remote areas of Lebowakgomo were characterized by higher percentage of food plants (47 species, 83.8% of the total food plants recorded) and medicinal plants (31 species, 83.7%). Lebowakgomo domestic gardens were also characterized by higher numbers of indigenous plants (76.7%) showing similarities to the natural surrounding vegetation in terms of plant species. On the contrary, domestic gardens of Seshego on the periphery of the city centre were characterized by higher percentage of exotic species (81.8%) and ornamental plants (73%), with food plants playing a supplementary role. Comparison of the two areas demonstrated a remarkable difference in plant use and composition. Conclusions This study revealed that there are differences in utilization of plant resources between households on the edge of an urban centre and those in the more remote areas. Food and medicinal plants play an important role in remote areas; while ornamental plants play an important role in urban domestic gardens. But the collective desire for food, medicinal and ornamental plants by both communities on the edge of an urban centre and those in the more remote areas highlight the importance of plant resources in domestic gardens.

AB  - Despite the increasing acceptance of traditional medicines in pen-urban areas in South Africa, this rich indigenous knowledge is not adequately documented. Therefore, an ethnobotanical study was undertaken to document medicinal plants grown and maintained in per-urban domestic gardens in the Capricorn District, Limpopo Province. Semi-structured interviews, observation and guided walks with 62 participants were employed to obtain ethnobotanical data on medicinal plants grown and maintained in peri-urban domestic gardens. Data collected included the names of plant species growing and maintained in domestic gardens as medicines, plant parts used, methods of herbal preparation and administration. A total of 37 species belonging to 34 genera and 27 families were recorded. Carica papaya, Catharanthus roseus, Cotyledon orbiculata, Crassula capitella, Erythrina lysistemon, Pelargonium peltatum, Pelargonium zonale, Sansevieria hyacinthoides, Schinus terebinthifolius and Sclerocarya birrea had the highest values of Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) and widely grown and managed by the inhabitants of the Limpopo Province. Cold, cough, sore throat, gastrointestinal disorders, fever, headache, injuries, circulatory system problems and sexually transmitted infections were treated with at least five species each. This study established that traditional medicines still play an important role in meeting basic health care needs of the local communities in the Limpopo Province.

AB  - Front gardens constitute a traditional form of greenery, mainly characteristic of single family house. Little gardens established in the areas adjacent to blocks of flats constitute a relatively new phenomenon in urban landscape. The occurrence of plants in front gardens of Lublin's housing estates was examined in the years 2008-2009. Two years ago were made additional comparative work in Leczna and Biala Podlaska in order to find out to the effect that species composition of front gardens. The studies were undertaken in order to determine the generic differentiation of the plants in spontaneously setting-up gardens. The list included all plants, if they were planted by the hosts of a darden, the plants from planned plantings performed by specialist firms within housing estate greenery management were neglected. In the case of synanthropic plants and spontaneously passing from natural communities, only those were taken into consideration, which were purposefully planted or incorporated into the gardens and were not an effect of negligence. In total 262 species were determined in 325 gardens. Perennial plants were predominant 152 species, one-year plants 52 and shrubs were represented by 49 plants, two-year plants - 9 species. As to the numerical force of occurrences in gardens the first place was taken by orris iris - 147 occurences, then tagetes, encountered in 133 gardens and roses - in 116.

AB  - Traditionally managed village yards have been disappearing from the Central-European countryside. Their lawn flora is likely to provide a unique habitat for many plants that are adapted to this environment. Composition of lawn flora was investigated in differently managed village yards (i.e., regularly mown and regularly trampled yards, poultry yards, paved yards) in southwestern Hungary. The main goal of the study was to detect the impacts of these different management regimes on the composition and diversity of the vegetation. In total, 240 1-m(2) plots were sampled in 60 yards ranging from 80 m(2) to 5,000 m(2) in size. In the redundancy analysis, eight significant variables (degree of southness, slope, age, total size of yards; mowing, trampling and grazing regime; and the number of dogs) explained 16 % of the total variation in species data. The most diverse flora across yards was detected in the paved ones, and their stands also proved to be the most compositionally distinctive. In contrast, presence of domestic animals can contribute to local species loss as well as to a decrease in within-yard-type variability. These results highlight the importance of certain anthropogenic disturbances in maintaining high plant diversity, but also underline the crucial role of small-scale land management practices in rural environments.

AB  - The chinampas (raised beds) of Xochimilco, Mexico City, are highly productive, traditional wetland agricultural systems, which were able to feed most of the population in pre-hispanic times. There is a strong trend to substitute chinampas with plastic greenhouses for flower production, which creates negative impacts in the landscape, environment and culture. This study compares the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of chinampas and greenhouses, at both the farm and regional levels, using the MESMIS framework. Even though the results show that greenhouses are more profitable, the contribution of chinampas to ecosystem services cannot be substituted by greenhouses, as tree cover is lost, canals are filled and food is not provided. Greenhouses had a higher diversity, but also a higher agrochemical use and are heavily dependent on external inputs and subsidies. Chinampas have shifted from staple crops to commercial horticulture in order to remain a technically viable and economically feasible option for local farmers. However, compensation mechanisms for the provision of ecosystem services are urgently needed if this ancient system is to be maintained. The framework allowed the integration of indicators at both farm and regional scales, combining on-farm surveys with GIS techniques, which could assist in ecosystem service valuation.

T2  - Landscape and Urban Planning
AB  - Urban agriculture offers a framework for local self-reliance by provisioning food security, employment opportunities, and other community benefits. However, urban agriculture must rely on the supporting and regulating services of the soil food web. Hence, we quantified belowground biocontrol activity in urban gardens and vacant lots in two post-industrial cities using an in situ insect baiting technique. Due to the differences in habitat structure, we hypothesized that belowground biocontrol services will differ between gardens and vacant lots and the influence of habitat structure would differ with the type of biocontrol organism. Results revealed that biocontrol activity, as assessed by % mortality of baited insects, varied between 51% and 98% with higher activity often recorded in vacant lots than gardens. Major contributions to bait insect mortality were by ants, followed by microbial pathogens and entomopathogenic nematodes, respectively. Ants showed higher (p<0.0001) % mortality in vacant lots (60%+/- 33.4%) than in urban gardens (33.3%+/- 22.2%) whereas microbial pathogens exhibited higher (p<0.0001) mortality in gardens (27.8%+/- 15%) than vacant lots (8.3%+/- 16.7%). Ants caused higher (p<0.0001) mortality when larger-mesh size cages were used compared with the smaller-mesh size cages, but mortality by microbial pathogens did not differ with cage type. The high biocontrol activity indicates the resilience of the soil food web in urban ecosystems and the differential effects of habitat structure on biocontrol activity can help guide landscape planning and vegetation management to enhance urban environments and boost local self-reliance.

AB  - The rapidly growing physical footprint of cities makes understanding residential landscaping preferences increasingly important for water quality, biodiversity conservation, and addressing climate change. In this paper we answer four interrelated questions about residential landscaping preferences with a case study in Raleigh, NC (1) How are residents' landscaping preferences influenced by what residents believe their neighbors prefer? (2) Do residents accurately assess their neighbors' landscaping preferences? (3) How does ethnicity influence landscaping preferences? and (4) Do the socio-demographic and neighborhood norm based correlates of landscaping preferences persist when both are accounted for in multivariate models? Respondents (n = 179) in this study preferred a 50% native plant garden design over 100% turf grass or the 75% and 100% native plant garden designs, and inaccurately assumed that their neighbors preferred turf over the native plant garden based landscaping designs. These results suggest that correcting erroneous assumptions about neighborhood preferences may alleviate normative pressure against adopting alternatives to turf grass landscaping. Although landscaping choices were best predicted by what residents perceived their neighbors preferred, ethnicity, income, and home ownership were also related to landscape preferences. African American ethnicity and income were positively related to preference for turf grass coverage. Environmental justice concerns linked to urban vegetation should be considered in light of the finding that African Americans appeared to prefer turf grass dominated landscaping. Results from this study indicate that middle income neighborhoods with high levels of home ownership may prove most receptive to initiatives aimed at increasing the use of more sustainable landscaping.

AB  - (Cultivation of food species in urban gardens in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil). Home gardens are urban spaces that guarantee human interaction with elements from the natural word, and the cultivation of food plants in these gardens can be important in complementing the diet of city residents. The goal of this work was to make an assessment of the eatable food plants grown in home gardens in the city of Rio Branco. In 2009 and 2010, on-site interviews were carried out using a questionnaire, which recorded the plant species of each kind of food, area of the gardens and the socioeconomic factors, for 132 gardens in Rio Branco. The neighborhoods selected for this study, Aeroporto Velho, Novo Horizonte and Placas, were located in the outskirts of the city. Seventy-seven food plants were recorded, which belong 10 34 plant families. Of these, Solanaceae (12.6%) and Myrtaceae (11.3%) with 62.0% of the kinds of fruits and 38.0% of the vegetables. Of the total number of plants recorded, 82.3% were exotic, 34.1% were medicinal and 18.9% were ornamental. No significant statistical association was detected between species and socioeconomic factors. Nonparametric analysis of variance indicated significant differences between neighborhoods, showing that Placas had a higher quantity of species. The quantity of species correlated positively in the home gardens. Food plants cultivated in Rio Branco gardens conserve agrobiodiversity and aid in the health and well-being of the residents by improving the landscape, ambience and leisure space of the city.

AB  - Wild plants have always been an important food source for people, not only in the distant past but also during more recent times of war. A wealth of information linked to human traditions has been gained on these plants which is worth preserving. As now these experiences are a prerogative primarily of the elderly in rural areas. A Phytoalimurgic Garden (PG) is a place where edible wild plants are grown as if in their natural environment and is planned to produce food all year round. To create a PG now, as food emergency no longer exists in Europe, means to exploit and spread these plants, promoting popular customs, old flavours and uses. The PG is intended for agro-tourism and teaching purposes, to spread ethno-botanical knowledge and preserve biodiversity. This paper describes how a PG in northern Italy was planned and is still managed. It could be an example for other experiences. Some of the species have been analyzed for their nutritional value

T2  - Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution
AB  - A verdant strip of urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) lines the banks of the River Nile at Khartoum (Sudan), but little is known about its physical structure and species composition. This study was conducted in 120 gardens, covering 160 ha at the urban locations of Tuti Island and Shambat and the peri-urban location of El Halfaya to determine the extent and plant composition of UPA gardens in Greater Khartoum, which includes the cities of Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman. The survey identified 84 plant species from 35 plant families, of which 47 were utilised as crops predominantly for commercial production of fruits, vegetables, spices and condiments, grains, and fodder. The gardens of Tuti Island, where production of lime (Citrus aurantiifolia (L.) Swingle) was widespread, had a mean species richness of 1.7 and a Shannon index of 0.4. The gardens of Shambat, where leafy vegetables were common, had higher crop diversity levels with a mean species richness of 4.4 and a Shannon index of 1.2. The gardens of El Halfaya, which was the only location where the production of some spices and condiments was recorded, had a mean species richness of 3.7 and a Shannon index of 1.0. All three study locations were largely dominated by monocultural commercial production relying heavily on external inputs. The four groups of gardens distinguished by cluster analysis were cultivated by 21 ethnic groups, 46% of the surveyed households relied on additional off-farm income and gardens supplied 12% of household food. Economic and ecological benefits of the studied UPA gardens might be enhanced if crop diversity and structural complexity of these gardens were increased.

AB  - Private, residential gardens form a substantial proportion of the undeveloped land in urban areas. Evaluating them role in supporting biodiversity is crucial to (i) predicting which plant and animal species can persist in towns and cities, (ii) understanding the regional Impacts of urbanisation, and (in) guiding sympathetic garden management by owners To obtain baseline information on a poorly-studied component of garden biodiversity, we measured the size and composition of the cryptogam assemblages in 61 domestic gardens in the city of Sheffield. UK. A total of 67 bryophyte and 77 lichen taxa were recorded Bryophytes ranged from 3 to 24 species per garden, with a mean richness of 11.3 species; lichens ranged from 2 to 30, with a mean of 14.9 species. Stone substrates supported the highest lichen richness. although minor substrates contributed unique species. Just over one fifth of bryophyte species were recorded in grass lawns, and these were more widespread than those of other habitats Most cryptogams were scarce, with around one quarter of both bryophytes and lichens occurring in single gardens, and only 10% wet e found in more than half of the gardens Gat den area - correlated with substrate richness - and garden altitude were the only two factors explaining variation in cryptogam richness (bryophytes 39.1%, lichens 32 4%) Positive correlations existed among bryophyte, lichen and vascular plant richness, and these were only partially mediated by the effect of garden area Therefore the opportunity remains for garden owners to support cryptogam richness, the most effective action being to enhance substrate diversity.

T2  - Ecology and Society
AB  - Biodiversity research in urban settings constitutes an interdisciplinary field combining both the natural and human sciences. A full understanding of the patterns and processes underlying the dynamic of biodiversity in urban ecosystems needs to include humans in models of ecological functioning. We focus on the planting practices of gardeners to identify the bottom-up and top-down human influences on the floral diversity of the Mediterranean gardens in an urbanizing rural zone. An initial ecological study of cultivated flora in 120 private gardens showing floristic pattern variations along an urbanization gradient was combined with a sociological survey. This survey aimed at collecting reasons for planting in gardens in connection with cultivated species. These reasons were classified into categories and analyzed according to the frequency of cultivated species within the entire gradient. Floristic heterogeneity in gardens, represented by the richness of uncommon species, is predominantly caused by social factors, particularly related to the practices and social networks of gardeners who tend to diversify the range of species that are planted. Floristic uniformity, defined by a high frequency of occurrence of plant species, results not only from social factors but also from natural factors that exert high pressure in the Mediterranean region. This "floristic norm" is also influenced by the urban context, which can modify the expression of natural and social factors and lead to differences in plant species compositions between housing density zones. More generally, these results stress the importance of considering both individual choices and city-level influences through an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the underlying processes that establish urban biodiversity patterns at a small scale.

T2  - California Agriculture
AB  - There is a growing need in the state of California for landscape plants that require fewer inputs of water and chemicals. To address this issue, a program was initiated at UC Davis to test the landscape potential of California native plants not currently in widespread horticultural use. Ten unused or underused California native plants were screened in open-field conditions for low water tolerance during summer 2006. In all cases, there were no significant differences in the summer growth or physical appearance between four irrigation levels. Six species maintained a favorable appearance throughout the season and were advanced to demonstration gardens in seven climate zones throughout the state, where Master Gardeners are performing further assessments on their performance. These irrigation and climate zone trials are part of an ongoing program coordinated by UC Cooperative Extension, the UC Davis Arboreturn and the California Center for Urban Horticulture to introduce more low water-use and low chemical-use plants through partnerships with the commercial horticultural industry.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Native plants in gardens can potentially aid conservation by contributing to genetic diversity and buffering small and otherwise isolated populations from extinction. However, gene flow from such plantings may threaten the genetic integrity of natural populations. We assessed the morphological and genetic diversity of garden plants in an urban population of Grevillea macleayana in south-eastern Australia. There were two main groups of garden plants some similar to plants in nearby natural populations; others with unusual morphology. Multivariate analysis of morphological characters separated these groupings, which were confirmed by genetic analysis. Both groups produced seeds and flowering phenologies overlapped, indicating a potential for gene flow. Hand pollination showed that plants in each group could fertilize flowers of the other. Thus, these garden plants contributed to genetic variation in an urban/bushland metapopulation but there was potential for gene flow from the unusual plants. Unless carefully managed, garden plants may therefore cause disruption of the genetic integrity of nearby natural populations.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Garden floras interact with native biodiversity by providing resources for wildlife and by acting as a source of non-native species. Understanding the composition and richness of garden floras will help evaluate the relationships between these floras and the wider environment. The composition and richness of vascular plant floras were measured in a stratified sample of 61 urban, domestic gardens in Sheffield, UK, based on complete garden inventories. The entire garden flora contained 1166 species, of which 30% were native and 70% alien. Across gardens, aliens showed lower occupancy than natives, comprising 79% of the species recorded only once. The garden flora contained 146 plant families, which included 72% of the native, naturalised or recurrent casual families recorded in the wild in Britain and Ireland. Gardens contained on average 45% natives, irrespective of garden size. Garden area explained 30% of the variation in species richness within individual gardens. Doubling garden size led to an increase in species richness of 25%. The garden flora comprised 10% annuals, 63% biennial/perennials, 18% shrubs and 8% trees; shrubs were disproportionately composed of alien species. The floras of urban domestic gardens probably form the greatest source of potentially invasive alien plants. However, the plants found in domestic gardens have closer affinities with the uncultivated flora than is often perceived, and their role for wildlife in gardens deserves reassessment. Declines in garden size that result from recommendations on the density of new housing are unlikely to have major consequences for plant richness in gardens.

AU  - Wezel, Alexander

T2  - Agroforestry Systems
AB  - Swidden cultivation is the traditional agricultural system in most parts of the Amazonian rain forest. In a remote area in the Manu National Park, Peru, this system was analysed in two indigenous Matsiguenka communities. Diversity of cultivated plants on fields and in homegardens are presented in the current study. Cultivated plants were noted on two to four plots per field on 46 fields, making a total of 126 survey plots. Nineteen homegardens were studied as well. Dominating species cultivated on fields is cassava (Manihot esculenta). Fruit trees such as the peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), guava (Psidium guajava) or Inga edulis, but also cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and a medicinal plant (Cyperus sp.) predominate in more than 75 % of the homegardens analysed. Species diversity increases steadily from 18 and 24 species on 1- and 2-year-old fields to 26, 29 and 66 species in young, medium old and old homegardens, respectively. Seventy-one different species in total were found in all homegardens analysed and 25 in swidden fields. Diversity of species cultivated in homegardens is low compared to other studies in the rain forest of the Amazon. This seems to be due to their remoteness from the next urban centre and to the fact that they are native communities with still low external exchange of information. These findings are in contrast to the hypothesis that remoteness from urban centres increases species richness because subsistence production is based on a broad variety of species. In contrast to species richness in homegardens, differences in species richness in swidden fields between the present and other studies could not be found.

AU  - Parris, Kirsten M.

T2  - Biological Conservation
AB  - Urban climates are known to differ from those of the surrounding rural areas, as human activities in cities lead to changes in temperature, humidity and wind regimes. These changes can in turn affect the geographic distribution of species, the behaviour of animals and the phenology of plants. The grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a large, nomadic bat from eastern Australia that roosts in large colonies known as camps. Historically a warm temperate to tropical species, P. poliocephalus recently established a year-round camp in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne. Using a bioclimatic analysis, we demonstrated that on the basis of long-term data, Melbourne does not fall within the climatic range of other P. poliocephalus camp sites in Australia. Melbourne is drier than other summer camps, and cooler and drier than other winter camps. The city also receives less radiation, in winter and annually, than the other summer and winter camps of P. poliocephalus. However, we found that temperatures in central Melbourne have been increasing since the 1950s, leading to warmer conditions and a reduction in the number of frosts. In addition, artificial watering of parks and gardens in the city may contribute the equivalent of 590mm (95% CI: 450–720mm) of extra rainfall per year. It appears that human activities have increased temperatures and effective precipitation in central Melbourne, creating a more suitable climate for camps of the grey-headed flying-fox. As demonstrated by this example, anthropogenic climate change is likely to complicate further the task of conserving biological diversity in urban environments.

AB  - Factors affecting the foraging of mobile native fauna in highly fragmented urban landscapes have seldom been quantified at large spatial scales. We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed Flying-foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus; ‘flying-foxes’) in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. Flying-foxes established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, and the size of the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratified-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging flying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0–5 and 5–20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30-km radius of the colony site for foraging flying-foxes in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging flying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. Flying-foxes were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. Flying-foxes in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization.

AB  - Question How do lawn floras compare with those of semi-natural grasslands? Are the compositions of lawn floras determined by local, within-garden factors (e.g. lawn management and size) or by regional factors (e.g. climate and location)? Are lawn floras nested (like semi-natural grasslands) or not (like cultivated parts of gardens)? Are there gradients of species composition within lawns? Location Sheffield, UK. Methods We examined the composition of the floras of entire lawns and of two 1-m(2) lawn quadrats in 52 gardens. Results A total of 159 species of vascular plants was recorded, 60 of them only once. Most lawn species were forbs, but most lawn cover consisted of grasses. Lawn species were predominantly natives. Bigger lawns had more species, but richness was not closely linked to other environmental or management variables. Composition of lawn floras varied with altitude, with woodland and wetland plants more common in the higher west of the city, and weeds of waste ground in the east. The species-area curve derived from 1-m(2) lawn quadrats was very similar to that of semi-natural grasslands. Lawn quadrats were significantly nested, with rarer species mostly confined to more species-rich quadrats. Trampling-tolerant Poa annua was more abundant in the part of the lawn nearer the house. Conclusions In most respects, lawns behaved much more like semi-natural grasslands than like cultivated flower beds and borders. Species composition of lawns is strongly influenced by local climate. Most lawns show an internal gradient of composition, linked to a gradient of intensity of use.

AB  - As part of a larger survey of biodiversity in gardens in Sheffield, UK, we examined the composition and diversity of the flora in two 1-m(2) quadrats in each of 60 gardens, and compared this with floristic data from semi-natural habitats in central England and derelict urban land in Birmingham, UK. Garden quadrats contained more than twice as many taxa as those from any other habitat type. Ca. 33 % of garden plants were natives and 67 % aliens, mainly from Europe and Asia. A higher proportion of garden aliens originated from Asia and New Zealand than in the UK alien flora as a whole; 18 of the 20 most frequent plants in garden quadrats were natives, mostly common weeds. Garden quadrats showed no evidence of 'nestedness', i.e. a tendency for scarce species to be confined to the highest diversity quadrats. Conversely, species in all semi-natural and derelict land data sets were significantly nested. Compared to a range of semi-natural habitats, species richness of garden quadrats was intermediate, and strikingly similar to the richness of derelict land quadrats. Although species accumulation curves for all other habitats showed signs of saturation at 120 quadrats, gardens did not. Correlations between Sorensen similarity index and physical distance were insignificant for all habitat types, i.e. there was little evidence that physical distance played any part in structuring the composition of the quadrats in any of the data sets. However, garden quadrats were much less similar to each other than quadrats from semi-natural habitats or derelict land.

AB  - We studied species composition, similarity, and structure of homegardens in two Yucatecan Maya communities, Tixpeual and Tixcacaltuyub, Yucatan, Mexico. The number of gardens sampled per village was 20 and 22; total area sampled was very similar, 45,265 m2 and 40,150 m2; the number of trees and shrubs present was 5651 and 5603; and number of species was 135 and 133, respectively. Diversity was low for both sites (H' = 1.6), as were the correlation coefficients (r) for the species-area and individuals-area correlations. The relatively low values obtained for the structural parameters reflect the random pattern of plant incorporation to the gardens, the variability in the proportion of constantly used and not constantly used garden area, and a certain uniformity in the number of species used and number of individuals present, and the relationship between these parameters and garden size. All these reflect the uniqueness of each homegarden, which depends upon the cultural background of the owner. We noticed a trend towards a change in homegarden structure and function in response to the modernization process. Homegardens in villages in the outskirts of cities tend to have more ornamental species and commercial fruit plants than homegardens in isolated villages.

TI  - Spatial scale affects seed predation and dispersal in contrasting anthropogenic landscapes
AU  - Pufal, Gesine
AU  - Klein, Alexandra-Maria
T2  - Basic and Applied Ecology
AB  - Seed predation and dispersal can have strong, albeit opposing effects on plant communities and their extent depends on interactions between seeds and their vectors (abiotic factors or different animal taxa). We assume that vectors, due to their specific requirements, act at different spatial scales and seed-vector interactions might differ greatly between landscapes. So far, it remains largely unclear, how the interaction between seeds and their vectors affects the degree of seed predation and dispersal in novel anthropogenic landscapes. We expect changes in patterns either at the landscape scale (urban vs. rural areas), habitat scale (habitat heterogeneity) or microhabitat scale (vegetation variability). We assessed seed predation and dispersal of two seed species by rodents, earthworms, other invertebrates and rain in cafeteria experiments in urban gardens and rural field margins and implemented generalized mixed effect models to test the effect of spatial scales and other environmental variables. Seed predation and dispersal were generally low and similar patterns emerged when the same vector facilitated the function. Overall, predation and dispersal were similar in urban and rural areas but when differentiating between vectors, scale effects were evident. Seed predation by rodents and earthworms was affected at the landscape scale, seed predation by other invertebrates increased with higher habitat heterogeneity and seed dispersal by rain was negatively affected at the microhabitat scale through increased plant cover. We show that one vector can facilitate the contrasting two functions, seed predation and dispersal, simultaneously, resulting in similar patterns at a specific spatial scale. However, different vectors might lead to contrasting patterns for the same function, depending on the spatial scale. This needs to be considered especially in anthropogenic areas, where ecosystem management decisions are also made at different spatial scales from private garden owners to landscape planning committees.

AU  - Philpott, Stacy M.
AU  - Bichier, Peter
T2  - Ecological Applications
AB  - In agroecosystems, local and landscape features, as well as natural enemy abundance and richness, are significant predictors of predation services that may result in biological control of pests. Despite the increasing importance of urban gardening for provisioning of food to urban populations, most urban gardeners suffer from high pest problems, and have little knowledge about how to manage their plots to increase biological control services. We examined the influence of local, garden scale (i.e., herbaceous and arboreal vegetation abundance and diversity, ground cover) and landscape (i.e., landscape diversity and surrounding land use types) characteristics on predation services provided by naturally occurring predators in 19 urban gardens in the California central coast. We introduced sentinel pests (moth eggs and larvae and pea aphids) onto greenhouse-raised plants taken to gardens and assigned to open or bagged (predator exclosure) treatments. We found high predation rates with between 40% and 90% of prey items removed in open treatments. Predation services varied with local and landscape factors, but significant predictors differed by prey species. Predation of eggs and aphids increased with vegetation complexity in gardens, but larvae predation declined with vegetation complexity. Smaller gardens experienced higher predation services, likely due to increases in predator abundance in smaller gardens. Several ground cover features influenced predation services. In contrast to patterns in rural agricultural landscapes, predation on aphids declined with increases in landscape diversity. In sum, we report the relationships between several local management factors, as well as landscape surroundings, and implications for garden management.
